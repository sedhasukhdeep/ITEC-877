Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which through casual or organised participation aim to use maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and in some cases entertainment for spectators Hundreds of sports exist from those between single contestants through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants either in teams or competing as individuals In certain sports such as racing many contestants may compete simultaneously or consecutively with one winner in others the contest a match is between two sides each attempting to exceed the other Some sports allow a tie or draw in which there is no single winner others provide tiebreaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season followed in some cases by playoffs
Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports However a number of competitive but nonphysical activities claim recognition as mind sports The International Olympic Committee through ARISF recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports and SportAccord the international sports federation association recognises five nonphysical sports bridge chess draughts checkers Go and xiangqi and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sportsSport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs which serve to ensure fair competition and allow consistent adjudication of the winner Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression
Records of performance are often kept and for popular sports this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news Sport is also a major source of entertainment for nonparticipants with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated and in some cases is central to the sport
According to AT Kearney a consultancy the global sporting industry is worth up to 620 billion as of 2013 The worlds most accessible and practised sport is running while association football is the most popular spectator sport

The word sport comes from the Old French desport meaning leisure with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being anything humans find amusing or entertainingOther meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling hunting and games and diversions including ones that require exercise Rogets defines the noun sport as an activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement with synonyms including diversion and recreation


==========
The singular term sport is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept eg children taking part in sport with sports used to describe multiple activities eg football and rugby are the most popular sports in England American English uses sports for both terms


==========

The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by SportAccord which is the association for all the largest international sports federations including association football athletics cycling tennis equestrian sports and more and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport
SportAccord uses the following criteria determining that a sport should
have an element of competition
be in no way harmful to any living creature
not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier excluding proprietary games such as arena football
not rely on any luck element specifically designed into the sportThey also recognise that sport can be primarily physical such as rugby or athletics primarily mind such as chess or Go predominantly motorised such as Formula 1 or powerboating primarily coordination such as billiard sports or primarily animalsupported such as equestrian sportThe inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports it is not open to admitting any further mind sports
There has been an increase in the application of the term sport to a wider set of nonphysical challenges such as video games also called esports especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations According to Council of Europe European Sports Charter article 2i Sport means all forms of physical activity which through casual or organised participation aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental wellbeing forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels


==========
There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport with almost all professional sport involving competition and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee IOC or SportAccordOther bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity For instance the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise including those competed just for fun
In order to widen participation and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants there has been an introduction of noncompetitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days although moves like this are often controversialIn competitive events participants are graded or classified based on their result and often divided into groups of comparable performance eg gender weight and age The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective and corrected with handicaps or penalties In a race for example the time to complete the course is an objective measurement In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges and therefore subjective There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time

Artifacts and structures suggest sport in China as early as 2000 BC Gymnastics appears to have been popular in Chinas ancient past Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports including swimming and fishing were welldeveloped and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing high jump and wrestling Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional Iranian martial art of Zourkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting

A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called OlympiaSports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century Industrialisation has brought increased leisure time letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication Professionalism became prevalent further adding to the increase in sports popularity as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes – all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports Since the turn of the 21st century there has been increasing debate about whether transgender sportspersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their posttransition gender identity

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play courtesy toward teammates and opponents ethical behaviour and integrity and grace in victory or defeatSportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake The wellknown sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice that its not that you won or lost but how you played the game and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin The most important thing is not winning but taking part are typical expressions of this sentiment


==========

Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win Rules are in place to ensure fair play but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage
Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains The widespread existence of gambling on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for match fixing where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win


==========

The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means
All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme looking for a list of banned drugs with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances


==========
Violence in sports involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence Athletes coaches fans and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property in misguided shows of loyalty dominance anger or celebration Rioting or hooliganism by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests

Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for child development and physical fitness Despite gains during the last three decades a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players Female players account for 39 of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32 increase in 1973–74 to a 63 increase in 1994–95 Hessel 2000


==========

Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun socialisation forming peer relationships physical fitness and athletic scholarships Activists for education and the war on drugs encourage youth sport as a means to increase educational participation and to fight the illegal drug trade According to the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Childrens Hospital the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including concussion These risks come from running basketball association football volleyball gridiron gymnastics and ice hockey Youth sport in the US is a 15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching


==========

Disabled sports also adaptive sports or parasports are sports played by persons with a disability including physical and intellectual disabilities As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability they are sometimes referred to as adapted sports However not all disabled sports are adapted several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in ablebodied sports


==========

The competition element of sport along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played This has led to the specific phenomenon of spectator sport
Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators both in person at the sport venue and through broadcast media including radio television and internet broadcast Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge such as an entrance ticket or payperview television broadcast
It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures The football World Cup attracts a global television audience of hundreds of millions the 2006 final alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final  attracted an estimated audience of 135 million in India aloneIn the United States the championship game of the NFL the Super Bowl has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year
Super Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in America the viewership being so great that in 2015 advertising space was reported as being sold at 45m for a 30second slot


==========

Sport can be undertaken on an amateur professional or semiprofessional basis depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation usually through payment of a wage or salary Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called grassroots sportThe popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for nonparticipants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right and this has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages which can run into millions of dollarsSome sports or individual competitions within a sport retain a policy of allowing only amateur sport The Olympic Games started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby From 1971 Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship and from 1986 the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics with the exceptions of boxing and wrestling


==========

Technology plays an important part in modern sport With it being a necessary part of some sports such as motorsport it is used in others to improve performance Some sports also use it to allow offfield decision making
Sports science is a widespread academic discipline and can be applied to areas including athlete performance such as the use of video analysis to finetune technique or to equipment such as improved running shoes or competitive swimwear Sports engineering emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport from analytics and big data to wearable technology In order to control the impact of technology on fair play governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants For example in 2010 fullbody nontextile swimsuits were banned by FINA as they were enhancing swimmers performancesThe increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken or reviewed offfield with another official using instant replays to make decisions In some sports players can now challenge decisions made by officials In Association football goalline technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not The technology is not compulsory but was used in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and the 2015 FIFA Womens World Cup in Canada as well as in the Premier League from 2013–14 and the Bundesliga from 2015–16 In the NFL a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth or a head coach can issue a challenge to review the play using replays The final decision rests with the referee A video referee commonly known as a Television Match Official or TMO can also use replays to help decisionmaking in rugby both league and union In international cricket an umpire can ask the Third umpire for a decision and the third umpire makes the final decision Since 2008 a decision review system for players to review decisions has been introduced and used in ICCrun tournaments and optionally in other matches Depending on the host broadcaster a number of different technologies are used during an umpire or player review including instant replays HawkEye Hot Spot and Real Time Snickometer HawkEye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions


==========

Sports and politics can influence each other greatly
Benito Mussolini used the 1934 FIFA World Cup which was held in Italy to showcase Fascist Italy Adolf Hitler also used the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin and the 1936 Winter Olympics held in GarmischPartenkirchen to promote the Nazi ideology of the superiority of the Aryan race and inferiority of the Jews and other undesirables Germany used the Olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the warWhen apartheid was the official policy in South Africa many sports people particularly in rugby union adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effectsIn the history of Ireland Gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism Until the mid20th century a person could have been banned from playing Gaelic football hurling or other sports administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association GAA if shehe played or supported Association football or other games seen to be of British origin Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and rugby union at Gaelic venues This ban also known as Rule 42 is still enforced but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road was redeveloped into Aviva Stadium Until recently under Rule 21 the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic games but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban
Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport or in its reporting people compete in national teams or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view On occasion such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue as in the Football War These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants
A very famous case when sport and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men This was known as the Munich massacre
A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the game before the election the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 15 percent A loss had the opposite effect and the effect is greater for higherprofile teams or unexpected wins and losses Also when Washington Redskins win their final game before an election then the incumbent President is more likely to win and if the Redskins lose then the opposition candidate is more likely to win this has become known as the Redskins Rule

Étienne de La Boétie in his essay Discourse on Voluntary Servitude describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them

Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed so to speak before their mouths Truly it is a marvelous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy Plays farces spectacles gladiators strange beasts medals pictures and other such opiates these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery the price of their liberty the instruments of tyranny By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke that the stupefied peoples fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes learned subservience as naïvely but not so creditably as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books


==========

Sport was an important form of worship in the Ancient Greek pagan religion The ancient Olympic Games called the Olympiad were held in honour of the head deity Zeus and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods As many Greeks travelled to see the games this combination of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them
The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry in which human beings extol themselves adore themselves sacrifice themselves and reward themselves Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of collective pride and national selfdeification in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worshipTertullian condemns the athletic performances of his day insisting the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry The shows says Tertullian excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian

God has enjoined us to deal calmly gently quietly and peacefully with the Holy Spirit because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature with His tenderness and sensitiveness  Well how shall this be made to accord with the shows For the show always leads to spiritual agitation since where there is pleasure there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest and where there is keenness of feeling there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that Then too where you have rivalry you have rage bitterness wrath and grief with all bad things which flow from them – the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ

==========The dollar sign or peso sign  or  is a symbol used to indicate the units of various currencies around the world including the peso and the US dollar The symbol can interchangeably have one or two vertical strokes In common usage the sign appears to the left of the amount specified eg 1 read as one dollar


==========
There are several hypotheses about the origin of the dollar sign

The sign is first attested in Spanish American American Canadian Mexican and other British business correspondence in the 1770s referring to the Spanish American peso also known as Spanish dollar or piece of eight in North America which provided the model for the currency that the United States adopted in 1792 and the larger coins of the new Spanish American republics such as the Mexican peso Peruvian eightreal and Bolivian eightsol coins
This explanation holds that the sign evolved out of the Spanish and Spanish American scribal abbreviation pˢ for pesos A study of late eighteenth and early nineteenthcentury manuscripts shows that the s gradually came to be written over the p developing into a close equivalent to the  mark A variation though less plausible of this hypothesis derives the sign from a combination of the Greek character psi ψ and S


==========
There are a number of other hypotheses about the origin of the symbol some with a measure of academic acceptance others the symbolic equivalent of false etymologiesAmong the various hypotheses the simplest one is that the barred S is actually a typo modified 8 from its obvious link with the pieces of eight the popular name of the Spanish dollar The added single or double bar should be the same commonly used to distinguish a letter dedicated to a currency value like £
Kingdom of Sicily
deniers minted by Manfred of Hohenstaufen in the Kingdom of Sicily between 1258 and 1266 had what can be construed as an early dollar symbol  These coins were widely circulated outside Europe due to the Crusades including the Crusade that targeted Tunis


==========

Another hypothesis holds that the sign derives from the symbolic representation of the Pillars of Hercules This representation can have either a banner separately around each pillar or as in the Spanish coat of arms a banner curling between them
In 1492 Ferdinand II of Aragon adopted the symbol of the Pillars of Hercules and added the Latin warning Non plus ultra meaning nothing further beyond indicating this is the end of the known world But when Christopher Columbus came to America the legend was changed to Plus ultra meaning further beyond The Pillars of Hercules wrapped in a banner thus became a symbol of the New World The link between this symbol and the dollar sign is more clearly seen in Spanish coins of the period which show two pillars each with a separate banner rather than one banner spanning both pillars In this example the righthand pillar resembles the dollar sign and additionally directly relates to the use of money

The symbol was adopted by Charles V and was part of his coat of arms representing Spains American possessions The symbol was later stamped on coins minted in gold and silver The coin also known as Spanish dollar was the first global currency used in the world since the Spanish Empire was the first global empire These coins depicting the pillars over two hemispheres and a small Sshaped ribbon around each were spread throughout America Europe and Asia According to this traders wrote signs that instead of saying Spanish dollar piece of eight real de a ocho in Spanish or peso duro had this symbol made by hand and this in turn evolved into a simple S with two vertical bars When the United States gained their independence from Great Britain they created the US dollar but in its early decades they continued to use the Spanish dollar which was more trusted in all markets
The United States even after independence was still using the pound sterling as currency This is attested in state legislation of the early 1780s referring to pounds and pence which predated the US Constitution and federal legislation
Given the origin of this theory – related to Spanish and Portuguese colonisation of the Americas – it is likely that the cifrão or peso signs share the same origin and that the double stroke usage is merely a stylistic variant rather than a distinct character


==========

Several alternative hypotheses relate specifically to the dollar sign drawn with two vertical lines


============
A dollar sign with two vertical lines could have started off as a monogram of USA used on money bags issued by the United States Mint The letters U and S superimposed resemble the historical doublestroke dollar sign  the bottom of the U disappears into the bottom curve of the S leaving two vertical lines It is postulated in the papers of Dr James Alton James a professor of history at Northwestern University from 1897 to 1935 that the symbol with two strokes was an adapted design of the patriot Robert Morris in 1778  Robert Morris was such a zealous patriot – known as the Financier of the Revolution in the West – that James came to believe that this hypothesis is viable A similar idea claims that the letters U and S would stand for unit of silver referencing pieces of eight again but that is unlikely since one would expect it to be in Spanish instead


============
Another hypothesis is that it derives from the symbol used on a German Thaler According to Ovason 2004 on one type of thaler one side showed a crucifix while the other showed a serpent hanging from a cross the letters NU near the serpents head and on the other side of the cross the number 21 This refers to the Bible Numbers Chapter 21 see Nehushtan
A similar symbol constructed by superposition of S and I or J was used to denote German Joachimsthaler S and J standing for St Joachim who gave his name to the place where the first thalers were minted It was known in the Englishspeaking world by the 17th century appearing in 1686 edition of An Introduction to Merchants Accounts by John Collins


==========
Robert Morris was the first to use this symbol in official documents and in official communications with Oliver Pollock The US dollar was directly based on the Spanish Milled Dollar when in the Coinage Act of 1792 the first Mint Act its value was fixed per the US Constitution Article I Section 8 clause 1 power of the United States Congress To coin Money regulate the Value thereof and of foreign Coin and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures as being of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current and to contain three hundred and seventyone grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver
According to a plaque in St Andrews Scotland the dollar sign was first cast into type at a foundry in Philadelphia United States in 1797 by the Scottish immigrants John Baine Archibald Binney and James Ronaldson

The dollar sign did not appear on US coinage until February 2007 when it was used on the reverse of a 1 coin authorized by the Presidential 1 Coin Act of 2005The dollar sign appears as early as 1847 on the 100 Mexican War notes and the reverse of the 1868 1000 United States note  The dollar sign also appears on the reverse of the 1934 100000 noteIn Japanese and Korean the Han character 弗 has been repurposed to represent the dollar sign due to its visual similarity


==========
The dollar sign is one of the few symbols that are almost universally present in computer character sets but rarely needed in their literal meanings within computer software  As a result the character has been used on computers for many purposes unrelated to money Its uses in programming languages have often influenced or provoked its uses in operating systems and applications

==========The 1934 FIFA World Cup was the second FIFA World Cup the world championship for mens national association football teams It took place in Italy from 27 May to 10 June 1934
The 1934 World Cup was the first for which teams had to qualify to take part Thirtytwo nations entered the competition and after qualification 16 teams participated in the finals tournament Reigning champions Uruguay refused to participate due to the fact that just four European teams had accepted their invitation to the 1930 tournament Italy became the second World Cup champions and the first European team to win beating Czechoslovakia 2–1 in the final
Like the Berlin Olympics two years later the 1934 World Cup was a highprofile instance of a sporting event being used for overt political gain Benito Mussolini was keen to use the tournament as a means of promoting fascismThe Federale 102 which was manufactured in Italy was the match ball provided for the 1934 World Cup


==========

After a lengthy decisionmaking process in which FIFAs executive committee met eight times Italy was chosen as the host nation at a meeting in Stockholm on 9 October 1932 The decision was taken by the executive committee without a ballot of members The Italian bid was chosen in preference to one from Sweden the Italian government assigned a budget of 35 million lire to the tournament


==========

36 countries applied to enter the tournament so qualifying matches were required to thin the field to 16 Even so there were several notable absentees Reigning World Cup holders Uruguay declined to participate in protest at the refusal of several European countries to travel to South America for the previous World Cup which Uruguay had hosted in 1930 As a result the 1934 World Cup is the only one in which the reigning champions did not participate The British Home Nations in a period of selfimposed exile from FIFA also refused to participate even though FIFA had offered England and Scotland direct entry to the tournament without qualification Football Association committee member Charles Sutcliffe called the tournament a joke and claimed that the national associations of England Scotland Wales and Ireland have quite enough to do in their own International Championship which seems to me a far better World Championship than the one to be staged in RomeDespite their role as hosts Italy were still required to qualify the first and only time the host nation needed to do so The qualifying matches were arranged on a geographical basis Withdrawals by Chile and Peru meant Argentina and Brazil qualified without playing a single matchTwelve of the 16 places were allocated to Europe three to the Americas and one to Africa or Asia including Turkey Only 10 of the 32 entrants and four of the 16 qualified teams Brazil Argentina United States and Egypt the first African team to qualify for a World Cup finals tournament were from outside Europe The last place in the finals was contested between the United States and Mexico only three days before the start of the tournament in a oneoff match in Rome which the United States won

1934 FIFA World at RSSSFcomThe 1936 Summer Olympics German Olympische Sommerspiele 1936 officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad was an international multisport event held in 1936 in Berlin Nazi Germany Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona Spain on 26 April 1931 at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona  It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games
To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932 Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler had a new 100000seat track and field stadium built as well as six gymnasiums and many other smaller arenas The games were the first to be televised and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for 7 million Her film titled Olympia pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports
Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism and the official Nazi party paper the Völkischer Beobachter wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods – although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club Hakoah Vienna did take part Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been sidelined in order not to offend the Nazi regimeTotal ticket revenues were 75 million Reichsmark generating a profit of over one million ℛℳ The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 165 million ℛℳ or outlays of the German national government which did not make its costs public but is estimated to have spent US30 millionJesse Owens won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events and became the most successful athlete to compete in Berlin while Germany was the most successful country overall with 89 medals total with the United States coming in second with 56 medals These were the final Olympics under the presidency of Henri de BailletLatour and the final Olympic Games for 12 years due to the disruption of the Second World War The next Olympic Games were held in 1948 the Winter in Switzerland and then the Summer in London


==========
At the 28th IOC Session held in 1930 in Berlin 14 cities announced their intention to bid to host the 1936 Summer Olympic Games
The bidding for these Olympic Games was the first to be contested by IOC members casting votes for their own favorite host citiesThe vote occurred in 1931 at the 29th IOC Session held in Barcelona that year The vote was held days after the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic and during the final years of the Weimar Republic This was two years before Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in 1933 
By the time of the 1931 IOC Session only Barcelona and Berlin were left in contention for the delegate vote Rome withdrew on the eve of the vote How other candidates withdrew is unclear as is the seriousness of intent behind all the of the listed candidate cities The other cities who announced an intention to hold the games but which withdrew from the race were Alexandria Budapest Buenos Aires Cologne Dublin Frankfurt Helsinki Lausanne Montevideo Nuremberg Rio de Janeiro  and Rome Helsinki Rome Barcelona and Rio de Janeiro would go on to host the Olympic Games in 1952 1960 1992 and 2016 respectivelyThe selection procedure marked the second and final time that the International Olympic Committee would gather to vote in a city which was bidding to host those Games The only other time this occurred was at the inaugural IOC Session in Paris France on 24 April 1894 Then Athens and Paris were chosen to host the 1896 and 1900 Games respectively 
The city of Barcelona held a multisport festival at the same time as the 1931 IOC Session This included a football match between Spain and the Irish Free State which was watched by 70000 spectators The political uncertainty around the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic which had happened days before the IOC Session was likely to have been a greater factor in the decision taken by delegates regarding the host city for 1936 Berlin prevailed 
After the Nazis took control of Germany and began instituting antisemitic policies the IOC held private discussions among its delegates about changing the decision to hold the Games in Berlin However Hitlers regime gave assurances that Jewish athletes would be allowed to compete on a German Olympic team


==========
Hans von Tschammer und Osten as Reichssportführer ie head of the Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen DRL the Reich Sports Office played a major role in the structure and organisation of the Olympics He promoted the idea that the use of sports would harden the German spirit and instill unity among German youth At the same time he also believed that sports was a way to weed out the weak Jewish and other undesirablesVon Tschammer trusted the details of the organisation of the games to Theodor Lewald and Carl Diem the former president and secretary of the Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen the forerunner of the Reich Sports Office Among Diems ideas for the Berlin Games was the introduction of the Olympic torch relay between Greece and the host nation


==========

The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the first of its kind following on from the reintroduction of the Olympic Flame at the 1928 Games It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue Leni Riefenstahl filmed the relay for the 1938 film Olympia

The sportive knightly battle awakens the best human characteristics It doesnt separate but unites the combatants in understanding and respect It also helps to connect the countries in the spirit of peace Thats why the Olympic Flame should never die


==========
The games were the first to have live television coverage The German Post Office using equipment from Telefunken broadcast over 70 hours of coverage to special viewing rooms throughout Berlin and Potsdam and a few private TV sets transmitting from the Paul Nipkow TV Station They used three different types of TV cameras so blackouts would occur when changing from one type to another


==========
The 1936 Olympic village is located at Elstal in Wustermark at 52°32′1078″N 13°0′3320″E on the western edge of Berlin The site which is 30 kilometres 19 mi from the centre of the city consisted of one and twofloor dormitories a large dining hall Dining Hall of the Nations a swimming facility gymnasium track and other training facilities Its layout was designed and construction overseen by appointed village commander Hauptmann Wolfgang Fürstner beginning in 1934 Less than two months before the start of the Olympic Games Fürstner was abruptly demoted to vicecommander and replaced by Oberstleutnant Werner von Gilsa commander of the Berlin GuardRegiment The official reason for the replacement was that Fürstner had not acted with the necessary energy to prevent damage to the site as 370000 visitors passed through it between 1 May and 15 June However this was just a cover story to explain the sudden demotion of the halfJewish officer The 1935 Nuremberg Laws passed during the period Fürstner was overseeing the Olympic Village had classified him as a Jew and as such the career officer was to be expelled from the Wehrmacht Two days after the conclusion of the Berlin Olympics vicecommander Fürstner had been removed from active Wehrmacht duty and committed suicide because he realised he had no future under the NazisAfter the completion of the Olympic Games the village was repurposed for the Wehrmacht into the Olympic Döberitz Hospital German OlympiaLazarett Döberitz and Army Infantry School German HeeresInfanterieschule and was used as such through the Second World War In 1945 it was taken over by the Soviet Union and became a military camp of the union occupation forces Late 20th century efforts were made to restore parts of the former village but little progress was made More recently the vast majority of the land of the Olympic village has been managed by the DKB Foundation with more success efforts are being made to restore the site into a living museum The dormitory building used by Jesse Owens Weissen House has been fully restored with the gymnasium and swimming hall partially restored Seasonally tours are given daily to small groups and studentsThe site remains relatively unknown even in Germany but some tournaments are held at the site in an effort to boost knowledge of the venues An effort aimed at 2018 completion is underway to make the village a mixed residential and historical property

The opening ceremony was held at the Berlin Olympic Stadium A flyover by the German airship Hindenburg flying the Olympic flag behind it was featured early in the opening ceremonies After the arrival of Hitler and his entourage the parade of nations proceeded each nation with its own unique costume As the birthplace of the Olympics Greece entered the stadium first The host nation Germany entered last Some nations athletes purposefully gave the Nazi salute as they passed Hitler Others gave the Olympic salute a similar one given with the same arm or a different gesture entirely such as hatsoverhearts as the United States and China did All nations lowered their flags as they passed the Führer save the United States The United States doing this was explained later as an army regulation Writer Thomas Wolfe who was there described the opening as an almost religious event the crowd screaming swaying in unison and begging for Hitler There was something scary about it his cult of personalityAfter a speech by the president of the German Olympic Committee the games were declared open by Adolf Hitler I proclaim open the Olympic Games of Berlin celebrating the Eleventh Olympiad of the modern era Hitler opened the games from his own box on top of others Writer David Wallechinsky has commented on the event saying This was his event he wanted to be glorifiedAlthough the Olympic flame was first introduced in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam this was the first instance of the torch relay The Nazis invented the concept of the torch run from ancient Olympia to the host city Thus as swimmer Iris Cummings Critchell later related once the athletes were all in place the torch bearer ran in through the tunnel to go around the stadium A young man chosen for this task ran up the steps all the way up to the top of the stadium there to light a cauldron which would start this eternal flame that would burn through the duration of the gamesBut in spite of all the pomp and ceremony and the glorification of Hitler all did not go according to plan and there was a rather humorous aspect in the opening ceremony US distance runner Louis Zamperini one of the athletes present related it on camera

India won the gold medal in the field hockey event once again they won the gold in all Olympics from 1928 to 1956 defeating Germany 8–1 in the final However Indians were considered IndoAryans by the Germans and there was no controversy regarding their victory Rie Mastenbroek of the Netherlands won three gold medals and a silver in swimming Estonias Kristjan Palusalu won gold medals in both Mens heavyweight Wrestling styles marking the last time Estonia competed as an independent nation in the Olympics until 1992

Italys football team continued their dominance under head coach Vittorio Pozzo winning the gold medal in these Olympics between their two consecutive World Cup victories 1934 and 1938 Much like the successes of German athletes this triumph was claimed by supporters of Benito Mussolinis regime as a vindication of the superiority of the fascist system Austria won the silver a controversial win after Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount Perus 4–2 win over Austria The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games In the quarterfinals of the football tournament Peru beat Austria 4–2 in extratime Peru rallied from a twogoal deficit in the final 15 minutes of normal time During extratime Peruvian fans allegedly ran onto the field and attacked an Austrian player In the chaos Peru scored twice and won 4–2 However Austria protested and the International Olympic Committee ordered a replay without any spectators The Peruvian government refused and their entire Olympic squad left in protest as did ColombiaA remarkable story from the track and field competition was the gold medal won by the US womens 4 × 100 m relay team The German team were the heavy favourites but dropped the baton at one handoff Of notable interest on the US team was Betty Robinson She was the first woman ever awarded an Olympic gold medal for track and field winning the womens 100 m event at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam In 1931 Robinson was involved in a plane crash and was severely injured Her body was discovered in the wreckage and it was wrongly thought that she was dead She was placed in the trunk of a car and taken to an undertaker where it was discovered that she was not dead but in a coma She awoke from the coma seven months later although it was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair and two years before she could walk normally again Due to the length of her recovery she had to miss participating in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in her home country


==========
A total of 49 nations attended the Berlin Olympics up from 37 in 1932 Five nations made their first official Olympic appearance at these Games Afghanistan Bermuda Bolivia Costa Rica and Liechtenstein

		


==========
Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy The official Nazi party paper the Völkischer Beobachter wrote in the strongest terms that Jewish people and Black people should not be allowed to participate in the Games However when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations he relented and allowed Black people and Jewish people to participate and added one token participant to the German team—a German woman Helene Mayer who had a Jewish father At the same time the party removed signs stating Jews not wanted and similar slogans from the citys main tourist attractions In an attempt to clean up the host city the German Ministry of the Interior authorized the chief of police to arrest all Romani Gypsies and keep them in a special camp the BerlinMarzahn concentration camp


==========
United States Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage became a main supporter of the Games being held in Germany arguing that politics has no place in sport despite having initial doubtsFrench Olympians gave a Roman salute at the opening ceremony known as the salut de Joinville per the battalion Bataillon de Joinville the Olympic salute was part of the Olympic traditions since the 1924 games However due to the different context this action was mistaken by the crowd for a support to fascism the Olympic salute was discarded after 1946Although Haiti attended only the opening ceremony an interesting vexillological fact was noticed its flag and the flag of Liechtenstein were coincidentally identical and this was not discovered until then The following year a crown was added to Liechtensteins to distinguish one flag from the other
American sprinters Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman the only two Jews on the US Olympic team were pulled from the 4 × 100 relay team on the day of the competition leading to speculation that Brundage did not want to add to Hitlers embarrassment by having two Jews win gold medalsIn 1937 Hollywood released the film Charlie Chan at the Olympics The plot concerned members of the Berlin police force helping the Chinese detective apprehend a group of spies of unnamed nationality trying to steal a new aerial guidance system Despite pertaining to the Berlin Olympics actual Games footage used by the filmmakers was edited to remove any Nazi symbolsAfter the Olympics Jewish participation in German sports was further limited and persecution of Jews started to become ever more lethal The Olympic Games had provided a ninemonth period of relative calmness


==========

The German Olympic committee in accordance with Nazi directives virtually barred Germans who were Jewish or Roma or had such an ancestry from participating in the Games Helene Mayer who had one Jewish parent was the only German Jew to compete at the Berlin Games This decision meant exclusion for many of the countrys top athletes such as shotputter and discus thrower Lilli Henoch who was a fourtime world record holder and 10time German national champion and Gretel Bergmann who was suspended from the German team just days after she set a record of 160 meters in the high jumpIndividual Jewish athletes from a number of countries chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics including South African Sid Kiel and Americans Milton Green and Norman Cahners In the United States the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee supported a boycott


==========
Prior to and during the Games there was considerable debate outside Germany over whether the competition should be allowed or discontinued Berlin had been selected by the IOC as the host city in 1931 but after Adolf Hitlers rise to power in 1933 observers in many countries began to question the morality of going ahead with an Olympic Games hosted by the Nazi regime A number of brief campaigns to boycott or relocate the Games emerged in the United Kingdom France Sweden Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands Exiled German political opponents of Hitlers regime also campaigned against the Berlin Olympics through proCommunist newspapers such as the ArbeiterIllustrierteZeitung
The protests were ultimately unsuccessful in 1935 the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States voted to compete in the Berlin Games and other countries followed suit Fortynine teams from around the world participated in the 1936 Games the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point


============

The Spanish government led by the newly elected leftwing Popular Front boycotted the Games and organized the Peoples Olympiad as a parallel event in Barcelona Some 6000 athletes from 49 countries registered However the Peoples Olympiad was aborted because of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War just one day before the event was due to start


============
The Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events since the 1920 Olympics The Soviet government was not invited to the 1920 Games with the Russian Civil War still raging and they did not participate in the 1924 Olympics and forward on ideological grounds Instead through the auspices of the Red Sport International it had participated in a leftwing workers alternative the Spartakiad since 1928 The USSR had intended to attend the Peoples Olympiad in Barcelona until it was cancelled the Soviets did attend the Spartakiadsponsored 1937 Workers Summer Olympiad in Antwerp Belgium The Soviet Union started competing in the Olympics in 1952 when Soviet leaders realized that they can use the event to fulfil their political and ideological agenda


============
Halet Çambel and Suat Fetgeri Așani the first Turkish and Muslim women athletes to participate in the Olympics fencing refused an offer by their guide to be formally introduced to Adolf Hitler saying they would not shake hands with him due to his approach to Jews as stated by Ms Çambel in a Milliyet newspaper interview in 2000


============

Traditionally the US sent one of the largest teams to the Olympics and there was a considerable debate over whether the United States should participate in the 1936 GamesThose involved in the debate on whether to boycott the Olympics included Ernest Lee Jahncke Judge Jeremiah Mahoney and future IOC President Avery Brundage Some within the United States considered requesting a boycott of the Games as to participate in the festivity might be considered a sign of support for the Nazi regime and its antisemitic policies However others such as Brundage see below argued that the Olympic Games should not reflect political views but rather should be strictly a contest of the greatest athletes
Avery Brundage then of the United States Olympic Committee opposed the boycott stating that Jewish athletes were being treated fairly and that the Games should continue Brundage asserted that politics played no role in sports and that they should never be entwined Brundage also believed that there was a JewishCommunist conspiracy that existed to keep the United States from competing in the Olympic Games Somewhat ironically Brundage would be later accused of being a Soviet dupe for his controversial stance on the Soviet sports system that allowed them to circumvent the amateur rules On the subject of Jewish discrimination he stated The very foundation of the modern Olympic revival will be undermined if individual countries are allowed to restrict participation by reason of class creed or raceDuring a factfinding trip that Brundage went on to Germany in 1934 to ascertain whether German Jews were being treated fairly Brundage found no discrimination when he interviewed Jews and his Nazi handlers translated for him and Brundage commiserated with his hosts that he belonged to a sports club in Chicago that did not allow Jews entry eitherUnlike Brundage Jeremiah Mahoney supported a boycott of the Games Mahoney the president of the Amateur Athletic Union led newspaper editors and antiNazi groups to protest against American participation in the Berlin Olympics He contested that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich
Most AfricanAmerican newspapers supported participation in the Olympics The Philadelphia Tribune and the Chicago Defender both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed AfricanAmerican pride American Jewish organizations meanwhile largely opposed the Olympics The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation The JLC organized the World Labor Athletic Carnival held on August 15 and 16 at New Yorks Randalls Island to protest the holding of the 1936 Olympics in Nazi GermanyEventually Brundage won the debate convincing the Amateur Athletic Union to close a vote in favor of sending an American team to the Berlin Olympics Mahoneys efforts to incite a boycott of the Olympic games in the United States failed
US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his administration did not become involved in the debate due to a tradition of allowing the US Olympic Committee to operate independently of government influence However several American diplomats including William E Dodd the American ambassador to Berlin and George Messersmith head of the US legation in Vienna deplored the US Olympic Committees decision to participate in the games
FranceFencer Albert Wolff qualified for the French Olympic Team but boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics withdrawing from Frances national team on principle because he was a Jew He said I cannot participate in anything sponsored by Adolf Hitler even for France

==========
Accusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germanys bid from the very beginning On the very day of the vote a hoax bribery affair was made public leading to calls for a revote On the night before the vote German satirical magazine Titanic sent letters to FIFA representatives offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey who had initially backed England had then been instructed to support South Africa following Englands elimination He abstained citing intolerable pressure on the eve of the vote Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed the vote would have resulted with a 12–12 tie and FIFA president Sepp Blatter who favoured the South African bid would have had to cast the deciding voteMore irregularities surfaced soon after including in the months leading up to the decision the sudden interest of German politicians and major businesses in the four Asian countries whose delegates were decisive for the vote Just a week before the vote the German government under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder lifted their arms embargo on Saudi Arabia and agreed to send grenade launchers to the country DaimlerChrysler invested several hundred million Euro in Hyundai while one of the sons of the companys founders was a member of FIFAs executive committee Both Volkswagen and Bayer announced investments in Thailand and South Korea whose respective delegates Worawi Makudi and Chung JongMoon were possible votes for Germany Makudi additionally received a payment by a company of German media mogul Leo Kirch who also paid millions for usually worthless TV rights for friendly matches of the German team and FC Bayern MunichOn 16 October 2015 the German news magazine Der Spiegel alleged that a slush fund with money from thenAdidas CEO Robert LouisDreyfus was used to influence the vote of four Asian members of the FIFA executive committee The sum of 67 million Euro was later demanded back by Dreyfus In order to retrieve the money the Organizing Committee paid an equivalent sum to the FIFA allegedly as a German share for the cost of a closing ceremony which never materialized Wolfgang Niersbach president of the German Football Association DFB denied the allegations on 17 October 2015 saying that the World Cup was not bought and that he could absolutely and categorically rule out the existence of a slush fund The DFB announced they would consider seeking legal action against Der Spiegel During a press conference on 22 October 2015 Nierbach repeated his stance emphasizing that the 67 million were used in 2002 to secure a subsidy by FIFA According to Niersbach the payment had been agreed upon during a meeting between Franz Beckenbauer and FIFA president Blatter with the money being provided by Dreyfus On the same day FIFA contradicted Niersbachs statement saying By our current state of knowledge no such payment of 10 million Franks was registered by FIFA in 2002 The following day former DFB president Theo Zwanziger publicly accused Niersbach of lying saying It is evident that there was a slush fund for the German World Cup application According to Zwanziger the 67 million Euros went to Mohamed Bin Hammam who at the time was supporting Blatters campaign for president against Issa HayatouOn 22 March 2016 it was announced that the FIFA Ethics Committee was opening proceedings into the bid

The following 32 teams shown with final pretournament rankings qualified for the final tournament


==========
In 2006 Germany had a plethora of football stadia that satisfied FIFAs minimum capacity of 40000 seats for World Cup matches The stillstanding Olympiastadion in Munich 69250 the venue for the 1974 final match was not used for the tournament even though FIFAs regulations allow one city to use two stadia Düsseldorfs LTU Arena 51500 Bremens Weserstadion 43000 and Mönchengladbachs BorussiaPark 46249 were also not used
Twelve stadia were selected to host the World Cup matches During the tournament many of them were known by different names as FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadia unless the stadium sponsors are also official FIFA sponsors For example the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during the competition as FIFA World Cup Stadium Munich German FIFA WMStadion München and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or covered Some of the stadia also had a lower capacity for the World Cup as FIFA regulations ban standing room nonetheless this was accommodated as several stadia had a UEFA fivestar ranking The stadia in Berlin Munich Dortmund and Stuttgart hosted six matches each while the other eight stadia hosted five matches each

Base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team

The eight seeded teams for the 2006 tournament were announced on 6 December 2005 The seeds comprised Pot A in the draw Pot B contained the unseeded qualifiers from South America Africa and Oceania Pot C contained eight of the nine remaining European teams excluding Serbia and Montenegro Pot D contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia A special pot contained Serbia and Montenegro this was done to ensure that no group contained three European teams In the special pot Serbia and Montenegro was drawn first then their group was drawn from the three seeded nonEuropean nations Argentina Brazil and Mexico
It had been predetermined that as the host Germany would be placed in Group A thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the draw FIFA had also announced in advance that Brazil the defending champion would be allocated to Group F

On 9 December 2005 the draw was held and the group assignments and order of matches were determined After the draw was completed commentators remarked that Group C appeared to be the group of death while others suggested Group E Argentina and the Netherlands both qualified with a game to spare with wins over Ivory Coast and Serbia and Montenegro respectively


==========
The first round or group stage saw the thirtytwo teams divided into eight groups of four teams Each group was a roundrobin of three games where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group Teams were awarded three points for a win one point for a draw and none for a defeat The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16


============
If teams were level on points they were ranked on the following criteria in order

Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches
Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches
If teams remained level after those criteria a minigroup would be formed from those teams who would be ranked on
Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie
Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie
Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie
If teams remained level after all these criteria FIFA would hold a drawing of lots
In the original version of the rules for the final tournament the ranking criteria were in a different order with headtohead results taking precedence over total goal difference The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria
In any event the final tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on points Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C Tunisia and Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H Both of these ties were resolved on total goal difference Also in both cases the teams had tied their match so the order of ranking criteria made no difference


==========

The finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each within which the teams competed in a roundrobin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteenteam knockout stage which started on 24 June In total 64 games were played


==========
Although Germany failed to win the Cup the tournament was considered a great success for Germany in general Germany also experienced a sudden increase in patriotic spirit with flag waving traditionally frowned upon by German society since World War II whenever the German team played For the closing ceremonies Matthias Keller composed a work performed simultaneously by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra with conductors Christian Thielemann Zubin Mehta and Mariss Jansons and soloists Diana Damrau Plácido Domingo and Lang Lang


==========
Despite early success by Australia Ecuador and Ghana the tournament marked a return to dominance of the traditional football powers Four years after a 2002 tournament in which teams from North America United States Africa Senegal and Asia South Korea made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and none of the quarterfinalists were from outside Europe or South America Six former champions took part in the quarterfinal round with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runnersup Portugal as the only relative outsiders Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarterfinals leaving an allEuropean final four for only the fourth time after the 1934 1966 and 1982 tournaments


==========
Despite the early goals that flooded the group stages the knockout phase had a much lower goals per match ratio A prime example of the dearth of goals was Portugal which only scored in the 23rd minute of the Round of 16 and did not score again until the 88th minute of the third place playoff No player managed to score a hattrick in this tournament Italy Germany Argentina Brazil and France were the only teams to score more than one goal in a knockout match Germany was one of the exceptions tending to play an attacking style of football throughout the knockout stage which was reflected by the fact that they scored the most goals 14 with players from all three outfield positions defence midfield and forward making the scoresheet
Germanys Miroslav Klose scored five goals to claim the Golden Boot the lowest total to win the prize since 1962 No other player scored more than three goals No player from the winning Italian squad scored more than two goals though ten players had scored for the team tying Frances record in 1982 for the most goalscorers from any one team
For the first time ever in the FIFA World Cup the first and last goals of the tournament were scored by defenders Philipp Lahm the German left wingback scored the opener against Costa Rica after only 5 minutes of the opening match In the final Marco Materazzi the Italian centre back outjumped Patrick Vieira and headed in the last goal of the 2006 FIFA World Cup


==========
The tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup Players received a recordbreaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarterfinal and semifinal matches respectively FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final should their teams make it that far The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatias Josip Šimunić in their match against Australia
The high number of yellow and red cards shown also prompted discussion about the referees FIFA Officials and President Sepp Blatter received criticism for allegedly making rules too rigid and taking discretion away from referees

============

============

In Group E Italy went through to the Round of 16 conceding just one goal an own goal in the group phase against the United States The US bowed out of the tournament after disappointing results against the Czech Republic and Ghana 0–3 and 1–2 respectively despite a 1–1 draw finishing with 9 vs 10 men against Italy Tournament debutant Ghana joined Italy in the round of 16 following victories over the Czech Republic and the United States Daniele De Rossi was suspended for 4 games following his sendingoff against the United States


============

Group F included the reigning World Champions Brazil Croatia Japan and Australia Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3–1 and despite losing 0–2 to Brazil a 2–2 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sentoff for second bookings and one erroneously for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the firsthalf by Kaká Croatia and Japan went out of the tournament without a single win


============

France only managed a scoreless draw against Switzerland and a 1–1 draw against South Korea With captain Zinedine Zidane suspended their 2–0 win against Togo was enough for them to advance to the knockout round They were joined by the group winners Switzerland who defeated South Korea 2–0 and did not concede a goal in the tournament South Korea won their first World Cup finals match outside their own country in defeating Togo but four points were not enough to see them through to the round of 16 the only team for which this was the case while Togo exited without a point


============

Spain dominated Group H picking up the maximum number of points scoring 8 goals and conceding only 1 Ukraine despite being beaten 4–0 by Spain in their first World Cup game took advantage of the weaker opponents to beat Saudi Arabia 4–0 and scrape past Tunisia 1–0 thanks to a 70thminute penalty by Andriy Shevchenko to reach the Round of 16 Saudi Arabia and Tunisia went out of the tournament having 1 point each thanks to a 2–2 draw against each other

============
In the second round conceding two early goals in the first twelve minutes to Germany effectively ended the Swedes hopes of progressing to the quarterfinals Argentina struggled to get past Mexico until a Maxi Rodríguez goal in extra time put the Albiceleste in the quarterfinals Australias journey ended when Italians were awarded a controversial penalty scored by Francesco Totti deep into the remaining seconds of the match The Italians had spent much of the game with only ten men on the field following an equally controversial red card shown to centre back Marco Materazzi In a 0–0 match Switzerland failed to convert any of their three penalties in the penalty shootout against Ukraine to see them exit the competition with an unwanted new record in becoming the first team in a World Cup to fail to convert any penalties in a shootout Their elimination also meant that they became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals and indeed the only nation ever to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal
England struggled against Ecuador but won 1–0 thanks to a David Beckham free kick Brazil won 3–0 against Ghana in a game which included Ronaldos record 15th World Cup goal Der Spiegel reported that the match may have been influenced by an Asian betting syndicate Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0 The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match which marked a new World Cup record with 16 yellow cards Portugal 9 the Netherlands 7 and 4 players being sent off for a second bookable offence France came from behind to defeat Spain 3–1 thanks to goals from Franck Ribéry Patrick Vieira and Zinedine Zidane

============
With Argentina and Brazil eliminated in the quarterfinals an allEuropean semifinal line up was completed for only the fourth time after the 1934 1966 and 1982 tournaments
The semifinal between Germany and Italy produced an extra time period that went scoreless until the 118th minute when Italy scored twice through Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero putting an end to Germanys undefeated record in Dortmund 
In the second semifinal Portugal lost to France 1–0 in Munich In a repeat of the Euro 1984 and Euro 2000 semifinals Portugal were defeated by France with the decisive goal being a penalty scored by France captain Zinedine Zidane


============
The hosts got three goals in 20 minutes in the second half with the help of 21yearold left midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger His first goal beat the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo with pace over his head Only 4 minutes later Schweinsteigers free kick 30 metres from the left of the penalty box driven low across goal was connected with Petits knee to become an own goal for Portugal The German did not stop and netted his second goal which swerved away to the keepers left in the 78th minute
Portugal were strong in possession but lacked punch in attack unable to convert 57 possession into goals Pauleta had two clear chances from 15 metres but both times hit tame shots that did not trouble keeper Oliver Kahn who was playing in his last match for the German national team Portugal got a consolation goal with the help of substitute Luís Figo also playing the final international game of his career who almost immediately provided the precise distribution needed to unlock the German defence A cross from the right wing on 88 minutes found fellow substitute Nuno Gomes at the far post who dived in for the goal The game ended 3–1 a result which gave the tournament hosts the bronze medals and left Portugal in fourth place


============

The final started with each side scoring within the first 20 minutes Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring by converting a controversial seventhminute penalty kick which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and bounced beyond the goal line before it spun back up hit the crossbar again and rebounded out of the goal Marco Materazzi then levelled the scores in the 19th minute following an Andrea Pirlo corner Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in normal time Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy he later had a header disallowed for offside while France were not awarded a possible second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta
At the end of the regulation 90 minutes the score was still level at 1–1 and the match was forced into extra time Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made a potentially gamesaving save in extra time when he tipped a Zidane header over the crossbar Further controversy ensued near the end of extra time when Zidane headbutted Materazzi in the chest in an offtheball incident and was sent off Extra time produced no further goals and a penalty shootout followed which Italy won 5–3 Frances David Trezeguet the man who scored the golden goal against Italy in Euro 2000 was the only player not to score his penalty his spot kick hit the crossbar landed on the goal line and went out It was the first allEuropean final since Italys triumph over West Germany in the 1982 World Cup and the second final after 1994 to be decided on penalties It was also Italys first world title in 24 years and their fourth overall making them the second most successful World Cup team ever The victory also helped Italy top the FIFA World Rankings in February 2007 for the first time since November 1993

India were drawn in Group B where they finished second behind South Africa They managed wins in four of their six games lost one against South Africa while their game against England was a high scoring tie
Sri Lanka had clinically demolished England in the quarter final defeating them by 10 wickets Both the Sri Lankan openers Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga made unbeaten centuries and put up a worldrecord stand for the first wicket in a World Cup The New Zealand semifinal was more keenly contested but was still won with relative ease by Sri Lanka The matches showcased the effective unconventional bowling of pace spearhead Lasith Malinga restrictive fielding and the batting prowess of the Sri Lankan top order
Both of Indias knockout matches were highpressure contests Australia was a strong team and the defending champions and India had to give a very good performance to restrict Australia to 260 and then successfully chase down the target even as wickets fell regularly Pakistan and India have historically been rivals and there was immense public pressure on both teams The match was attended by the Prime Ministers of both India and Pakistan India batted first and ultimately defeated Pakistan by 29 runs


==========
India largely retained the same team it had in the semifinal against Pakistan with just one change Ashish Nehra leftarm medium pacer had suffered a finger fracture while fielding in that match and he was replaced by another pacer Sreesanth India was widely rated as having the strongest batting lineup in the tournament and chose to back this strength throughout the campaign by playing seven batsmen and four bowlers Due to Yuvraj Singh performing well with both bat and ball in the tournament India could afford to play with only four specialist bowlers Yuvraj bowled his full quota of 10 overs in many matches including the semifinal against Pakistan Among the four bowling slots Zaheer Khan was the pace spearhead supported in most matches by Munaf Patel while Harbhajan Singh was the regular offspinner The fourth slot was taken by different bowlers in different matches including Sreesanth Nehra legspinner Piyush Chawla or offspinner Ravichandran Ashwin The captain had chosen Nehra over Ashwin in the match against Pakistan also Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had then said he preferred having three seamers because it gave him more options He already had proven spinners in Harbhajan and Yuvraj and could call upon many other Indian players who can bowl parttime spin including Sachin Tendulkar Suresh Raina and Virender Sehwag
Sri Lanka made four changes to their side from the semifinal Allrounder Angelo Mathews had suffered a torn quadriceps and could not play Sri Lanka knew the Indians strength was batting and thus they needed to take wickets to put them under pressure This led to their choosing a full complement of bowlers Spin bowler Ajantha Mendis had performed well throughout the tournament but he had a poor record against India in preWorld Cup clashes and was not chosen for the final Spinner Rangana Herath was also dropped Offspinner Suraj Randiv and batsman Chamara Kapugedera were flown in from Sri Lanka to strengthen the side Seamers Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera who had played matches in the earlier group stage were drafted into the team Legendary spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was carrying minor injuries but was retained He had announced that he would retire from One Day International cricket after the World Cup so this was his last match The semifinal held at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo was his last ODI match on home soil and there he had been carried around the stadium perched on his teammates shoulders on a lap of honour after that match

A controversy developed when Kumar Sangakkara called the toss The toss came up as heads but the match referee Jeff Crowe did not hear the call over the crowd It was decided that there would be a retoss Sangakkara called heads as the coin was spun the second time He won the retoss and decided to bat


==========
Sri Lanka started the innings slowly constrained by good bowling from Zaheer Khan and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli inside the 30yard circle Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Upul Tharanga conceding only six runs in his fiveover spell Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan Singh when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves Captain Kumara Sangakkara came in after Tharangas dismissal and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed Mahela Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 602 in the 17th over Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48 New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out Chamara Kapugedera who was playing his first World Cup match was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan Jayawardene meanwhile continued with his quality batting ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a highclass batting display Helped by the hardhitting of Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs including 63 in the batting powerplay 45–50 overs to take the score to 2746


==========
India had a shaky start with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar both dismissed early by Lasith Malinga leaving them struggling at 31 for two Sehwag was trapped LBW for a duck on the second ball of the innings Tendulkar started with some good strokes racing to 18 off 14 balls but then edged a catch to wicketkeeper Sangakkara Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets taking India to 114 before Kohli was caughtandbowled by Tillakaratne Dilshan for 35 When he was on 30 Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv sending the ball high up in the air but Nuwan Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83run partnership before Kohlis dismissal Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five usually the position of Yuvraj Singh Both Kohli and Dhoni are righthanded batsmen while Gambhir and Yuvraj are lefthanded Along with other considerations by coming ahead of Yuvraj Dhoni ensured there would be a rightleft batting combination between him and Gambhir which makes it difficult for the bowlers to get into a rhythm and necessitates frequent field changes Both Gambhir and Dhoni emphasised on preserving the wickets and later accelerating with a greater flow of boundaries Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97 Gambhir tried to finish his century with a boundary but his heaving bat failed to connect with the ball and he was bowled by Thisara Perera Following Gambhirs dismissal 52 runs were required off 52 balls Yuvraj Singh was the new batsman and along with Dhoni
took India to victory and Dhoni sealed the match hitting a six off Nuwan Kulasekarawhen only 4 runs were required off 11 balls Dhoni finished on 91 not out from 79 deliveries Like in many other daynight matches in the subcontinent dew started to form on the outfield grass in the night making the ball damp and difficult to grip especially in the later part of Indias batting However this was a known factor and was taken into consideration by the Sri Lankan captain when he chose to bat first after winning the toss By crossing the target of 274 India had set a record for the highest successful runchase in a World Cup finalAt the end of the match the batting strength of both the teams stood out The three top run scorers of this tournament were from these finalists Tillekaratne Dilshan 500 runs Sachin Tendulkar 482 and Kumar Sangakkara 465 In the top 10 tournament scorers there were 3 from Sri Lanka Upul Tharanga 395 in addition to the previous two and 4 from India Gautam Gambhir 393 Virender Sehwag 380 and Yuvraj Singh 362 in addition to Sachin

==========

The 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups In preparation for this the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highestranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot As with the previous tournaments FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cupwinning players Under the draw procedure one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams

To avoid ghost goals the 2014 World Cup introduced goalline technology following successful trials at among others 2013 Confederations Cup The chosen Goal Control system featured 14 high speed cameras 7 directed to each of the goals Data were sent to the central imageprocessing centre where a virtual representation of the ball was output on a widescreen to confirm the goal The referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and displayed a signal upon a goal Frances second goal in their group game against Honduras was the first time goalline technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be givenFollowing successful trials FIFA approved the use of vanishing spray by the referees for the first time at a World Cup Finals The waterbased spray which disappears within minutes of application can be used to mark a tenyard line for the defending team during a free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kickThe Adidas Brazuca was the official match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot Pakistan Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the previous World Cup The number of panels was reduced to six with the panels being thermally bonded This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor Furthermore Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals


==========
Because of the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil particularly at the northern venues cooling breaks for the players were introduced Breaks could take place at the referees discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded 32 °C 90 °F
