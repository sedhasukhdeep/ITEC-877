 Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which through casual or organised participation aim to use maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and in some cases entertainment for spectators Hundreds of sports exist from those between single contestants through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants either in teams or competing as individuals In certain sports such as racing many contestants may compete simultaneously or consecutively with one winner in others the contest a match is between two sides each attempting to exceed the other Some sports allow a tie or draw in which there is no single winner others provide tiebreaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season followed in some cases by playoffs
Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports However a number of competitive but nonphysical activities claim recognition as mind sports The International Olympic Committee through ARISF recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports and SportAccord the international sports federation association recognises five nonphysical sports bridge chess draughts checkers Go and xiangqi and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sportsSport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs which serve to ensure fair competition and allow consistent adjudication of the winner Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression
Records of performance are often kept and for popular sports this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news Sport is also a major source of entertainment for nonparticipants with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated and in some cases is central to the sport
According to AT Kearney a consultancy the global sporting industry is worth up to 620 billion as of 2013 The worlds most accessible and practised sport is running while association football is the most popular spectator sport

Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task Programming involves tasks such as analysis generating algorithms profiling algorithms accuracy and resource consumption and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language commonly referred to as coding The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers rather than machine code which is directly executed by the central processing unit The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task which can be as complex as an operating system on a computer often for solving a given problem The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects including knowledge of the application domain specialized algorithms and formal logic
Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing debugging source code maintenance implementation of build systems and management of derived artifacts such as the machine code of computer programs These might be considered part of the programming process but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming implementation or coding reserved for the actual writing of code Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices Reverse engineering is the opposite process A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem but it can also mean a security hacker in common language

Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD when the automata of AlJazari were programmable via pegs and cams to play various rhythms and drum patterns and the 1801 Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the program  a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them
However the first computer program is generally dated to 1843 when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers intended to be carried out by Charles Babbages Analytical Engine

In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machinereadable form Later a control panel plugboard added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs and by the late 1940s unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604 were programmed by control panels in a similar way as were the first electronic computers However with the concept of the storedprogram computers introduced in 1949 both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memoryMachine code was the language of early programs written in the instruction set of the particular machine often in binary notation Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format eg ADD X TOTAL with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses However because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages

Highlevel languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable and less bound to the underlying hardware FORTRAN the first widely used highlevel language to have a functional implementation came out in 1957 and many other languages were soon developed – in particular COBOL aimed at commercial data processing and Lisp for computer research
Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape See computer programming in the punch card era By the late 1960s data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers Text editors were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards

The word sport comes from the Old French desport meaning leisure with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being anything humans find amusing or entertainingOther meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling hunting and games and diversions including ones that require exercise Rogets defines the noun sport as an activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement with synonyms including diversion and recreation



==========

The singular term sport is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept eg children taking part in sport with sports used to describe multiple activities eg football and rugby are the most popular sports in England American English uses sports for both terms



==========

Whatever the approach to development may be the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties The following properties are among the most important

Reliability how often the results of a program are correct This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms and minimization of programming mistakes such as mistakes in resource management eg buffer overflows and race conditions and logic errors such as division by zero or offbyone errors
Robustness how well a program anticipates problems due to errors not bugs This includes situations such as incorrect inappropriate or corrupt data unavailability of needed resources such as memory operating system services and network connections user error and unexpected power outages
Usability the ergonomics of a program the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues This involves a wide range of textual graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity intuitiveness cohesiveness and completeness of a programs user interface
Portability the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a program can be compiledinterpreted and run This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms including hardware and operating system resources expected behavior of the hardware and operating system and availability of platform specific compilers and sometimes libraries for the language of the source code
Maintainability the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations fix bugs and security holes or adapt it to new environments Good practices during initial development make the difference in this regard This quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term
Efficiencyperformance Measure of system resources a program consumes processor time memory space slow devices such as disks network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction the less the better This also includes careful management of resources for example cleaning up temporary files and eliminating memory leaks

The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by SportAccord which is the association for all the largest international sports federations including association football athletics cycling tennis equestrian sports and more and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport
SportAccord uses the following criteria determining that a sport should
have an element of competition
be in no way harmful to any living creature
not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier excluding proprietary games such as arena football
not rely on any luck element specifically designed into the sportThey also recognise that sport can be primarily physical such as rugby or athletics primarily mind such as chess or Go predominantly motorised such as Formula 1 or powerboating primarily coordination such as billiard sports or primarily animalsupported such as equestrian sportThe inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports it is not open to admitting any further mind sports
There has been an increase in the application of the term sport to a wider set of nonphysical challenges such as video games also called esports especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations According to Council of Europe European Sports Charter article 2i Sport means all forms of physical activity which through casual or organised participation aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental wellbeing forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels

In computer programming readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose control flow and operation of source code It affects the aspects of quality above including portability usability and most importantly maintainability
Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading trying to understand and modifying existing source code rather than writing new source code Unreadable code often leads to bugs inefficiencies and duplicated code A study found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it
Following a consistent programming style often helps readability However readability is more than just programming style Many factors having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code contribute to readability Some of these factors include

Different indent styles whitespace
Comments
Decomposition
Naming conventions for objects such as variables classes procedures etcThe presentation aspects of this such as indents line breaks color highlighting and so on are often handled by the source code editor but the content aspects reflect the programmers talent and skills
Various visual programming languages have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability concerns by adopting nontraditional approaches to code structure and display Integrated development environments IDEs aim to integrate all such help Techniques like Code refactoring can enhance readability



==========

There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport with almost all professional sport involving competition and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee IOC or SportAccordOther bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity For instance the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise including those competed just for fun
In order to widen participation and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants there has been an introduction of noncompetitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days although moves like this are often controversialIn competitive events participants are graded or classified based on their result and often divided into groups of comparable performance eg gender weight and age The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective and corrected with handicaps or penalties In a race for example the time to complete the course is an objective measurement In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges and therefore subjective There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time



==========

The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem For this purpose algorithms are classified into orders using socalled Big O notation which expresses resource use such as execution time or memory consumption in terms of the size of an input Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of wellestablished algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances

Artifacts and structures suggest sport in China as early as 2000 BC Gymnastics appears to have been popular in Chinas ancient past Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports including swimming and fishing were welldeveloped and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing high jump and wrestling Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional Iranian martial art of Zourkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting

A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called OlympiaSports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century Industrialisation has brought increased leisure time letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication Professionalism became prevalent further adding to the increase in sports popularity as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes – all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports Since the turn of the 21st century there has been increasing debate about whether transgender sportspersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their posttransition gender identity

The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis followed by testing to determine value modeling implementation and failure elimination debugging There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks One approach popular for requirements analysis is Use Case analysis Many programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years There are many approaches to the Software development process
Popular modeling techniques include ObjectOriented Analysis and Design OOAD and ModelDriven Architecture MDA The Unified Modeling Language UML is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA
A similar technique used for database design is EntityRelationship Modeling ER Modeling
Implementation techniques include imperative languages objectoriented or procedural functional languages and logic languages

Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play courtesy toward teammates and opponents ethical behaviour and integrity and grace in victory or defeatSportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake The wellknown sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice that its not that you won or lost but how you played the game and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin The most important thing is not winning but taking part are typical expressions of this sentiment



==========


It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages Methods of measuring programming language popularity include counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language the number of books sold and courses teaching the language this overestimates the importance of newer languages and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL
Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications For example COBOL is still strong in corporate data centers often on large mainframe computers Fortran in engineering applications scripting languages in Web development and C in embedded software Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use  New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added for example C++ adds objectorientation to C and Java adds memory management and bytecode to C++ but as a result loses efficiency and the ability for lowlevel manipulation



==========


Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win Rules are in place to ensure fair play but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage
Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains The widespread existence of gambling on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for match fixing where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win



==========


Debugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages Use of a static code analysis tool can help detect some possible problems Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem This can be a nontrivial task for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs Also specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem
After the bug is reproduced the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug For example a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file However after simplification of the test case only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash Such simplification can be done manually using a divideandconquer approach The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists When debugging the problem in a GUI the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear
Debugging is often done with IDEs like Eclipse Visual Studio Xcode Kdevelop NetBeans and CodeBlocks Standalone debuggers like GDB are also used and these often provide less of a visual environment usually using a command line Some text editors such as Emacs allow GDB to be invoked through them to provide a visual environment



==========


The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means
All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme looking for a list of banned drugs with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances



==========


Different programming languages support different styles of programming called programming paradigms The choice of language used is subject to many considerations such as company policy suitability to task availability of thirdparty packages or individual preference Ideally the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected Tradeoffs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team the availability of compilers for that language and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute Languages form an approximate spectrum from lowlevel to highlevel lowlevel languages are typically more machineoriented and faster to execute whereas highlevel languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly It is usually easier to code in highlevel languages than in lowlevel ones
Allen Downey in his bookHow To Think Like A Computer Scientist writes

The details look different in different languages but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language
Input Gather data from the keyboard a file or some other device
Output Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device
Arithmetic Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication
Conditional Execution Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements
Repetition Perform some action repeatedly usually with some variationMany computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by shared libraries Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate runtime conventions eg method of passing arguments then these functions may be written in any other language

The competition element of sport along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played This has led to the specific phenomenon of spectator sport
Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators both in person at the sport venue and through broadcast media including radio television and internet broadcast Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge such as an entrance ticket or payperview television broadcast
It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures The football World Cup attracts a global television audience of hundreds of millions the 2006 final alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final  attracted an estimated audience of 135 million in India aloneIn the United States the championship game of the NFL the Super Bowl has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year
Super Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in America the viewership being so great that in 2015 advertising space was reported as being sold at 45m for a 30second slot

Sport can be undertaken on an amateur professional or semiprofessional basis depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation usually through payment of a wage or salary Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called grassroots sportThe popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for nonparticipants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right and this has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages which can run into millions of dollarsSome sports or individual competitions within a sport retain a policy of allowing only amateur sport The Olympic Games started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby From 1971 Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship and from 1986 the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics with the exceptions of boxing and wrestling

Technology plays an important part in modern sport With it being a necessary part of some sports such as motorsport it is used in others to improve performance Some sports also use it to allow offfield decision making
Sports science is a widespread academic discipline and can be applied to areas including athlete performance such as the use of video analysis to finetune technique or to equipment such as improved running shoes or competitive swimwear Sports engineering emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport from analytics and big data to wearable technology In order to control the impact of technology on fair play governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants For example in 2010 fullbody nontextile swimsuits were banned by FINA as they were enhancing swimmers performancesThe increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken or reviewed offfield with another official using instant replays to make decisions In some sports players can now challenge decisions made by officials In Association football goalline technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not The technology is not compulsory but was used in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and the 2015 FIFA Womens World Cup in Canada as well as in the Premier League from 2013–14 and the Bundesliga from 2015–16 In the NFL a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth or a head coach can issue a challenge to review the play using replays The final decision rests with the referee A video referee commonly known as a Television Match Official or TMO can also use replays to help decisionmaking in rugby both league and union In international cricket an umpire can ask the Third umpire for a decision and the third umpire makes the final decision Since 2008 a decision review system for players to review decisions has been introduced and used in ICCrun tournaments and optionally in other matches Depending on the host broadcaster a number of different technologies are used during an umpire or player review including instant replays HawkEye Hot Spot and Real Time Snickometer HawkEye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions

Sports and politics can influence each other greatly
Benito Mussolini used the 1934 FIFA World Cup which was held in Italy to showcase Fascist Italy Adolf Hitler also used the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin and the 1936 Winter Olympics held in GarmischPartenkirchen to promote the Nazi ideology of the superiority of the Aryan race and inferiority of the Jews and other undesirables Germany used the Olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the warWhen apartheid was the official policy in South Africa many sports people particularly in rugby union adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effectsIn the history of Ireland Gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism Until the mid20th century a person could have been banned from playing Gaelic football hurling or other sports administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association GAA if shehe played or supported Association football or other games seen to be of British origin Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and rugby union at Gaelic venues This ban also known as Rule 42 is still enforced but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road was redeveloped into Aviva Stadium Until recently under Rule 21 the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic games but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban
Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport or in its reporting people compete in national teams or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view On occasion such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue as in the Football War These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants
A very famous case when sport and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men This was known as the Munich massacre
A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the game before the election the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 15 percent A loss had the opposite effect and the effect is greater for higherprofile teams or unexpected wins and losses Also when Washington Redskins win their final game before an election then the incumbent President is more likely to win and if the Redskins lose then the opposition candidate is more likely to win this has become known as the Redskins Rule

Étienne de La Boétie in his essay Discourse on Voluntary Servitude describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them

Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed so to speak before their mouths Truly it is a marvelous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy Plays farces spectacles gladiators strange beasts medals pictures and other such opiates these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery the price of their liberty the instruments of tyranny By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke that the stupefied peoples fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes learned subservience as naïvely but not so creditably as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books

Sport was an important form of worship in the Ancient Greek pagan religion The ancient Olympic Games called the Olympiad were held in honour of the head deity Zeus and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods As many Greeks travelled to see the games this combination of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them
The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry in which human beings extol themselves adore themselves sacrifice themselves and reward themselves Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of collective pride and national selfdeification in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worshipTertullian condemns the athletic performances of his day insisting the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry The shows says Tertullian excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian

God has enjoined us to deal calmly gently quietly and peacefully with the Holy Spirit because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature with His tenderness and sensitiveness  Well how shall this be made to accord with the shows For the show always leads to spiritual agitation since where there is pleasure there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest and where there is keenness of feeling there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that Then too where you have rivalry you have rage bitterness wrath and grief with all bad things which flow from them – the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ

There are several hypotheses about the origin of the dollar sign

The sign is first attested in Spanish American American Canadian Mexican and other British business correspondence in the 1770s referring to the Spanish American peso also known as Spanish dollar or piece of eight in North America which provided the model for the currency that the United States adopted in 1792 and the larger coins of the new Spanish American republics such as the Mexican peso Peruvian eightreal and Bolivian eightsol coins
This explanation holds that the sign evolved out of the Spanish and Spanish American scribal abbreviation pˢ for pesos A study of late eighteenth and early nineteenthcentury manuscripts shows that the s gradually came to be written over the p developing into a close equivalent to the  mark A variation though less plausible of this hypothesis derives the sign from a combination of the Greek character psi ψ and S

There are a number of other hypotheses about the origin of the symbol some with a measure of academic acceptance others the symbolic equivalent of false etymologiesAmong the various hypotheses the simplest one is that the barred S is actually a typo modified 8 from its obvious link with the pieces of eight the popular name of the Spanish dollar The added single or double bar should be the same commonly used to distinguish a letter dedicated to a currency value like £
Kingdom of Sicily
deniers minted by Manfred of Hohenstaufen in the Kingdom of Sicily between 1258 and 1266 had what can be construed as an early dollar symbol  These coins were widely circulated outside Europe due to the Crusades including the Crusade that targeted Tunis

Another hypothesis holds that the sign derives from the symbolic representation of the Pillars of Hercules This representation can have either a banner separately around each pillar or as in the Spanish coat of arms a banner curling between them
In 1492 Ferdinand II of Aragon adopted the symbol of the Pillars of Hercules and added the Latin warning Non plus ultra meaning nothing further beyond indicating this is the end of the known world But when Christopher Columbus came to America the legend was changed to Plus ultra meaning further beyond The Pillars of Hercules wrapped in a banner thus became a symbol of the New World The link between this symbol and the dollar sign is more clearly seen in Spanish coins of the period which show two pillars each with a separate banner rather than one banner spanning both pillars In this example the righthand pillar resembles the dollar sign and additionally directly relates to the use of money

The symbol was adopted by Charles V and was part of his coat of arms representing Spains American possessions The symbol was later stamped on coins minted in gold and silver The coin also known as Spanish dollar was the first global currency used in the world since the Spanish Empire was the first global empire These coins depicting the pillars over two hemispheres and a small Sshaped ribbon around each were spread throughout America Europe and Asia According to this traders wrote signs that instead of saying Spanish dollar piece of eight real de a ocho in Spanish or peso duro had this symbol made by hand and this in turn evolved into a simple S with two vertical bars When the United States gained their independence from Great Britain they created the US dollar but in its early decades they continued to use the Spanish dollar which was more trusted in all markets
The United States even after independence was still using the pound sterling as currency This is attested in state legislation of the early 1780s referring to pounds and pence which predated the US Constitution and federal legislation
Given the origin of this theory – related to Spanish and Portuguese colonisation of the Americas – it is likely that the cifrão or peso signs share the same origin and that the double stroke usage is merely a stylistic variant rather than a distinct character

ACM Computing Classification System is the homepage of the system including links to four complete versions of the system for 1964 1 1991 2 1998 3 and the current 2012 version 4
The ACM Computing Research Repository uses a classification scheme that is much coarser than the ACM subject classification and does not cover all areas of CS but is intended to better cover active areas of research In addition papers in this repository are classified according to the ACM subject classificationA Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge BABOK Guide is a standard for the practice of business analysis

Several alternative hypotheses relate specifically to the dollar sign drawn with two vertical lines



==========

BABOK Guide was first published by International Institute of Business Analysis IIBA as a draft document version 14 in October 2005 for consultation with the wider business analysis and project management community to document and standardize generally accepted business analysis practices The first formal release was at version 16 in June 2006 Version 20 was released 31 March 2009  Version 3 was released in April 2015

A dollar sign with two vertical lines could have started off as a monogram of USA used on money bags issued by the United States Mint The letters U and S superimposed resemble the historical doublestroke dollar sign  the bottom of the U disappears into the bottom curve of the S leaving two vertical lines It is postulated in the papers of Dr James Alton James a professor of history at Northwestern University from 1897 to 1935 that the symbol with two strokes was an adapted design of the patriot Robert Morris in 1778  Robert Morris was such a zealous patriot – known as the Financier of the Revolution in the West – that James came to believe that this hypothesis is viable A similar idea claims that the letters U and S would stand for unit of silver referencing pieces of eight again but that is unlikely since one would expect it to be in Spanish instead



==========

Once the body of knowledge was established IIBA created the Certified Business Analysis Professional CBAP designation to recognise senior business analysts who could demonstrate indepth longterm experience in these knowledge areas 5–10 years in a dedicated business analyst roleIIBA also offers the Certification of Competency on Business Analysis CCBA designation that recognizes Business Analysts with 3750 hours business analysis experience including 900 hours experience in two knowledge areas or 500 hours experience in four knowledge areas and 21 professional development hoursFor both certifications above the applicant must have a minimum high school education or equivalent two references from a career manager client or Certified Business Analyst Professional and sign the IIBA Code of ConductIIBA also offers the Entry Certificate in Business Analysis ECBA that does not require a reference

Another hypothesis is that it derives from the symbol used on a German Thaler According to Ovason 2004 on one type of thaler one side showed a crucifix while the other showed a serpent hanging from a cross the letters NU near the serpents head and on the other side of the cross the number 21 This refers to the Bible Numbers Chapter 21 see Nehushtan
A similar symbol constructed by superposition of S and I or J was used to denote German Joachimsthaler S and J standing for St Joachim who gave his name to the place where the first thalers were minted It was known in the Englishspeaking world by the 17th century appearing in 1686 edition of An Introduction to Merchants Accounts by John Collins

Robert Morris was the first to use this symbol in official documents and in official communications with Oliver Pollock The US dollar was directly based on the Spanish Milled Dollar when in the Coinage Act of 1792 the first Mint Act its value was fixed per the US Constitution Article I Section 8 clause 1 power of the United States Congress To coin Money regulate the Value thereof and of foreign Coin and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures as being of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current and to contain three hundred and seventyone grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver
According to a plaque in St Andrews Scotland the dollar sign was first cast into type at a foundry in Philadelphia United States in 1797 by the Scottish immigrants John Baine Archibald Binney and James Ronaldson

The dollar sign did not appear on US coinage until February 2007 when it was used on the reverse of a 1 coin authorized by the Presidential 1 Coin Act of 2005The dollar sign appears as early as 1847 on the 100 Mexican War notes and the reverse of the 1868 1000 United States note  The dollar sign also appears on the reverse of the 1934 100000 noteIn Japanese and Korean the Han character 弗 has been repurposed to represent the dollar sign due to its visual similarity

BABOK Guide organizes business analysis tasks within 6 knowledge areas Each task describes the typical knowledge skills deliverables and techniques that the business analyst requires to be able to perform those tasks competently The knowledge areas logically organize tasks but do not specify a sequence process or methodology
The knowledge areas of BABOK Guide are

Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring describes the tasks used to organize and coordinate business analysis efforts
Elicitation and Collaboration describes the tasks used to prepare for and conduct elicitation activities and confirm the results
Requirements Life Cycle Management  the tasks used to manage and maintain requirements and design information from inception to retirement
Strategy Analysis describes the tasks used to identify the business need address that need and align the change strategy within the enterprise
Requirements Analysis and Design Definition describes the tasks used to organize requirements specify and model requirements and designs validate and verify information identify solution options and estimate the potential value that could be realized
Solution Evaluation describes the tasks used to assess the performance of and value delivered by a solution and to recommend improvements on increasing values



==========

The dollar sign is one of the few symbols that are almost universally present in computer character sets but rarely needed in their literal meanings within computer software  As a result the character has been used on computers for many purposes unrelated to money Its uses in programming languages have often influenced or provoked its uses in operating systems and applications

In Haskell  is used as a function application operator
In an AutoHotkey script a hotkey declared with  is not triggered by a Send command elsewhere in the script
In several JavaScript frameworks such as Prototypejs and jQuery  is a common utility class and is often referred to as the buck
In JavaScript from ES6 onward it is used inside template literals to insert the value of a variable For example if var word = such then `as word` would equal as such

International Institute of Business AnalysisAcceptance test–driven development ATDD is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers the developers and the testers ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example SBE behaviordriven development BDD exampledriven development EDD and supportdriven development also called story test–driven development SDD All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customers needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language
ATDD is closely related to testdriven development TDD  It differs by the emphasis on developertesterbusiness customer collaboration   ATDD encompasses acceptance testing but highlights writing acceptance tests before developers begin coding

In CPM and subsequently in all versions of DOS 86DOS MSDOS PC DOS more and derivatives  is used as a string terminator Int 21h with AH=09h
 is used by the prompt command to insert special sequences into the DOS command prompt string
In Microsoft Windows  is appended to the share name to hide a shared folder or resource For example servershare will be visible to other computers on a network while servershare will be accessible only by explicit reference Hiding a shared folder or resource will not alter its access permissions but may render it unaccessible to programs or other functions which rely on its visibility Most administrative shares are hidden in this way
In Unixlike systems the  is often part of the command prompt depending on the users shell and environment settings For example the default environment settings for the bash shell specify  as part of the command prompt
The using history expansion  same as 1 and 1 means the last argument of the previous command in bash 2 expands to the last argument of the penultimate command 5 expands into the last argument of the fifth command and so on For example
where  expands into myfirstfileIn the LDAP directory access protocol  is used as a line separator in various standard entry attributes such as postalAddress
In the UNIVAC EXEC 8 operating system  means system It is appended to entities such as the names of system files the sender name in messages sent by the operator and the default names of systemcreated files like compiler output when no specific name is specified eg TPF NAME etc
In RISC OS  is used in system variables to separate the application name from the variables specific to that application For example DrawDir specifies the directory where the Draw application is located It is also used to refer to the root directory of a file system



==========

Acceptance tests are from the users point of view – the external view of the system They examine externally visible effects such as specifying the correct output of a system given a particular input  Acceptance tests can verify how the state of something changes such as an order that goes from paid to shipped  They also can check the interactions with interfaces of other systems such as shared databases or web services  In general they are implementation independent although automation of them may not be



==========

Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet software use the dollar sign  to denote a fixed row fixed column reference or an absolute cell reference
The dollar sign introduces a subfield delimiter in computer coding of library catalog records
 matches the end of a line or string in sed grep and POSIX and Perl regular expressions and as a result
 signifies the end of a line or the file in text editors ed ex vi pico and derivatives



==========

Acceptance tests are created when the requirements are analyzed and prior to coding  They can be developed collaboratively by requirement requester product owner business analyst customer representative etc developer and tester  Developers implement the system using the acceptance tests  Failing tests provide quick feedback that the requirements are not being met  The tests are specified in business domain terms  The terms then form a ubiquitous language that is shared between the customers developers and testers Tests and requirements are interrelated A requirement that lacks a test may not be implemented properly  A test that does not refer to a requirement is an unneeded test  An acceptance test that is developed after implementation begins represents a new requirement

In addition to those countries of the world that use dollars or pesos a number of other countries use the  symbol to denote their currencies including

Nicaraguan córdoba usually written as C
Samoan tālā a transliteration of the word dollar
Tongan paʻangaAn exception is the Philippine peso whose sign is written as ₱
The dollar sign is also still sometimes used to represent the Malaysian ringgit which replaced the local dollar though its official use to represent the currency has been discontinued since 1993
Some currencies use the cifrão  similar to the dollar sign but always with two strokes

Cape Verde escudo
Portuguese escudo defunctIn Mexico and other pesousing countries the cifrão is used as a dollar sign when a document uses both pesos and dollars at the same time to avoid confusion but when the dollar sign is used alone not in conjunction with the cifrão it is usually represented as US  United States dollars or by its ISO 4217 code USD Example US 5 or 5 USD five US dollarsHowever in Argentina the  sign is always used for pesos and if they want to indicate dollars they always write US 5 or US5 5 US dollars
In the United States Mexico Australia Argentina New Zealand Hong Kong Pacific Island nations and Englishspeaking Canada the dollar or peso symbol precedes the number Five dollars or pesos is written and printed as 5 whereas five cents is written as 5¢ In Frenchspeaking Canada the dollar symbol usually appears after the number 5



==========

Acceptance tests are a part of an overall testing strategy They are the customer tests that demonstrate the business intent of a system Component tests are technical acceptance tests developed by an architect that specify the behavior of large modules  Unit tests are created by the developer to drive easytomaintain code They are often derived from acceptance tests and unit tests  Crossfunctional testing includes usability testing exploratory testing and property testing scaling and security



==========

The symbol is sometimes used derisively to indicate greed or excess money such as in Microoft George Luca Lar Ulrich Diney Chelea and GW or supposed overt Americanisation as in ky The dollar sign is also used intentionally to stylize names such as AAP Rocky Keha and Ty Dolla ign or words such as ¥€ In 1872 Ambrose Bierce referred to the California Governor as tealand LandfordIn Scrabble notation a dollar sign is placed after a word to indicate that it is valid according to the North American word lists but not according to the British word listsDollar sign was used as a letter in Turkmen alphabet from 1993 to 1999



==========

Acceptance criteria are a description of what would be checked by a test Given a requirement such as “As a user I want to check out a book from the library” an acceptance criterion might be “Verify the book is marked as checked out  An acceptance test for this requirement gives the details so that the test can be run with the same effect each time

Some virtual worldgaming platforms also use the  symbol to refer virtual currencies of a respective platform for example

R  Robux Roblox not to be confused with Brazilian real
S  Sansar Dollars Sansar
L  Linden Dollars Second Life

The previous steps do not include any specific example data so that is added to complete the test
Given

Book that has not been checked outUser who is registered on the systemWhen

User checks out a bookThen

Book is marked as checked out



==========

Examination of the test with specific data usually leads to many questions For the sample these might be

What if the book is already checked out
What if the book does not exist
What if the user is not registered on the system
Is there a date that the book is due to be checkedin
How many books can a user check outThese questions help illuminate missing or ambiguous requirements  Additional details such as a duedate can be added to the expected result  Other acceptance tests can check that conditions such as attempting to check out a book that is already checked out produces the expected error

The 1934 FIFA World Cup was the second FIFA World Cup the world championship for mens national association football teams It took place in Italy from 27 May to 10 June 1934
The 1934 World Cup was the first for which teams had to qualify to take part Thirtytwo nations entered the competition and after qualification 16 teams participated in the finals tournament Reigning champions Uruguay refused to participate due to the fact that just four European teams had accepted their invitation to the 1930 tournament Italy became the second World Cup champions and the first European team to win beating Czechoslovakia 2–1 in the final
Like the Berlin Olympics two years later the 1934 World Cup was a highprofile instance of a sporting event being used for overt political gain Benito Mussolini was keen to use the tournament as a means of promoting fascismThe Federale 102 which was manufactured in Italy was the match ball provided for the 1934 World Cup

After a lengthy decisionmaking process in which FIFAs executive committee met eight times Italy was chosen as the host nation at a meeting in Stockholm on 9 October 1932 The decision was taken by the executive committee without a ballot of members The Italian bid was chosen in preference to one from Sweden the Italian government assigned a budget of 35 million lire to the tournament



==========

In addition to acceptance tests for requirements acceptance tests can be used on a project as a whole For example if this requirement was part of a library book checkout project there could be acceptance tests for the whole project These are often termed SMART objectives An example test is When the new library system is in production the users will be able to check books in and out three times as fast as they do today

Example of automation frameworksAugusta Ada King Countess of Lovelace née Byron 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852 was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbages proposed mechanical generalpurpose computer the Analytical Engine She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine As a result she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a computing machine and one of the first computer programmersLovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron All of Byrons other children were born out of wedlock to other women Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins Is thy face like thy mothers my fair child ADA sole daughter of my house and heart He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old Her mother remained bitter and promoted Adas interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her fathers perceived insanity Despite this Ada remained interested in Byron Upon her eventual death she was buried next to him at her request Although often ill in her childhood Ada pursued her studies assiduously She married William King in 1835 King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838 Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace
Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse Charles Babbage Sir David Brewster Charles Wheatstone Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens contacts which she used to further her education Ada described her approach as poetical science and herself as an Analyst  MetaphysicianWhen she was a teenager her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage who is known as the father of computers She was in particular interested in Babbages work on the Analytical Engine Lovelace first met him in June 1833 through their mutual friend and her private tutor Mary Somerville
Between 1842 and 1843 Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes simply called Notes These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbages personal notes from the years 18361837 contain the first programs for the engine Lovelaces notes are important in the early history of computers She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or numbercrunching while many others including Babbage himself focused only on those capabilities Her mindset of poetical science led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine as shown in her notes examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative toolShe died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36

The group stage used in the first World Cup was discarded in favour of a straight knockout tournament  If a match was tied after ninety minutes then thirty minutes of extra time were played  If the score was still tied after extra time the match was replayed the next day
The eight seeded teams – Argentina Brazil Germany Italy the Netherlands Austria Czechoslovakia and Hungary – were kept apart in the first round



==========


All eight firstround matches kicked off at the same time Hosts and favourites Italy won handsomely defeating the USA 7–1 The New York Times correspondent wrote that only the fine goaltending of Julius Hjulian of Chicago kept the score as low as it was

Internal disputes meant Argentinas squad for the tournament did not contain a single member of the team which had reached the final in 1930 Against Sweden in Bologna Argentina twice took the lead but two goals by Sven Jonasson and a winner by Knut Kroon gave Sweden a 3–2 victory Fellow South Americans Brazil also suffered an early exit Spain beat them comfortably 3–1 the final scoreFor the only time in World Cup history the last eight consisted entirely of European teams – Austria Czechoslovakia Germany Hungary Italy Spain Sweden and Switzerland  All four nonEuropean teams who made the journey to Italy were eliminated after one match
In the quarterfinals the first replayed match in World Cup history took place when Italy and Spain drew 1–1 after extra time The match was played in a highly aggressive manner with several players of both sides injured rough play injured the Spanish goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora in the first match leaving him unable to participate in the replay while on the other side rough play by Spaniards broke the leg of the Italian Mario Pizziolo who would not play in the national team again Italy won the replay 1–0 their play so physical that at least three Spaniards had to depart the field with injuries Italy then went on to beat Austria in the semifinals by the same score Meanwhile Czechoslovakia secured their place in the final by beating Germany 3–1
The Stadium of the National Fascist Party was the venue for the final With 80 minutes played the Czechoslovaks led 1–0 The Italians managed to score before the final whistle and then added another goal in extra time to be crowned World Cup winners

Lord Byron expected his child to be a glorious boy and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl The child was named after Byrons halfsister Augusta Leigh and was called Ada by Byron himself On 16 January 1816 at Lord Byrons command Lady Byron left for her parents home at Kirkby Mallory taking their fiveweekold daughter with her Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights but did request that his sister keep him informed of Adas welfare

On 21 April Lord Byron signed the deed of separation although very reluctantly and left England for good a few days later Aside from an acrimonious separation Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husbands immoral behaviour This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society She did not have a relationship with her father He died in 1824 when she was eight years old Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthdayLovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith Hon Lady Milbanke who doted on her However because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation—Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughters welfare with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern In one letter to Lady Milbanke she referred to her daughter as it I talk to it for your satisfaction not my own and shall be very glad when you have it under your own Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation Lovelace dubbed these observers the Furies and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her

Lovelace was often ill beginning in early childhood At the age of eight she experienced headaches that obscured her vision In June 1829 she was paralysed after a bout of measles She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year something which may have extended her period of disability By 1831 she was able to walk with crutches Despite the illnesses she developed her mathematical and technological skills

When Ada was twelve years old this future Lady Fairy as Charles Babbage affectionately called her decided she wanted to fly Ada Byron went about the project methodically thoughtfully with imagination and passion Her first step in February 1828 was to construct wings She investigated different material and sizes She considered various materials for the wings paper oilsilk wires and feathers She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body She decided to write a book Flyology illustrating with plates some of her findings She decided what equipment she would need for example a compass to cut across the country by the most direct road so that she could surmount mountains rivers and valleys Her final step was to integrate steam with the art of flying
Ada Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833 She tried to elope with him after she was caught but the tutors relatives recognized her and contacted her mother Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal Lovelace never met her younger halfsister Allegra the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five Lovelace did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh the daughter of Byrons halfsister Augusta Leigh who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court

Lovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833 She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville and they corresponded for many years Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse Sir David Brewster Charles Wheatstone Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen and became a popular belle of the season in part because of her brilliant mind By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events She danced often and was able to charm many people and was described by most people as being dainty although John Hobhouse Byrons friend described her as a large coarseskinned young woman but with something of my friends features particularly the mouth This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him probably due to her mothers influence which led her to dislike all of her fathers friends This first impression was not to last and they later became friendsOn 8 July 1835 she married William 8th Baron King becoming Lady King They had three homes Ockham Park Surrey a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Rossshire and a house in London They spent their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir Somerset The Manor had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time From 1845 the familys main house was East Horsley Towers rebuilt in the Victorian Gothic fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament Charles BarryThey had three children Byron born 12 May 1836 Anne Isabella called Annabella born 22 September 1837 and Ralph Gordon born 2 July 1839 Immediately after the birth of Annabella Lady King experienced a tedious and suffering illness which took months to cure Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838 her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace In 1843–44 Adas mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Adas children and to act as a moral instructor for Ada He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an unbecoming manner When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair Ada cut it offIn 1841 Lovelace and Medora Leigh the daughter of Lord Byrons halfsister Augusta Leigh were told by Adas mother that her father was also Medoras father On 27 February 1841 Ada wrote to her mother I am not in the least astonished In fact you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron but instead blamed Augusta Leigh I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals firstly from a relaxed approach to extramarital relationships with men leading to rumours of affairs and secondly from her love of gambling She apparently lost more than £3000 on the horses during the later 1840s The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets This went disastrously wrong leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate forcing her to admit it all to her husband She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosses son John from 1844 onwards John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her During her final illness she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her

Throughout her illnesses she continued her education Her mothers obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by William Frend William King and Mary Somerville the noted 19thcentury researcher and scientific author One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan From 1832 when she was seventeen her mathematical abilities began to emerge and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life In a letter to Lady Byron De Morgan suggested that her daughters skill in mathematics could lead her to become an original mathematical investigator perhaps of firstrate eminenceLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science While studying differential calculus she wrote to De Morgan

I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of who are at ones elbows in one shape now and the next minute in a form most dissimilar
Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics viewing both as tools for exploring the unseen worlds around us



==========


Lovelace died at the age of 36 – the same age at which her father had died – on 27 November 1852 from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians The illness lasted several months in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw and excluded all of her friends and confidants Under her mothers influence she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside It is not known what she told him She was buried at her request next to her father at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall Nottinghamshire A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers



==========

Throughout her life Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day including phrenology and mesmerism After her work with Babbage Lovelace continued to work on other projects In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings a calculus of the nervous system She never achieved this however In part her interest in the brain came from a longrunning preoccupation inherited from her mother about her potential madness As part of her research into this project she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments In the same year she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach Researches on Magnetism but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft In 1851 the year before her cancer struck she wrote to her mother mentioning certain productions she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music

Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833 through their mutual friend Mary Somerville Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could Babbage was impressed by Lovelaces intellect and analytic skills He called her The Enchantress of Number In 1843 he wrote to her

Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans—every thing in short but the Enchantress of Number

During a ninemonth period in 1842–43 Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabreas article on Babbages newest proposed machine the Analytical Engine With the article she appended a set of notes Explaining the Analytical Engines function was a difficult task as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it Lovelaces notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine Her work was well received at the time the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writingThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include in Note G in complete detail a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine which might have run correctly had it ever been built only Babbages Difference Engine has been built completed in London in 2002 Based on this work Lovelace is now widely considered to be the first computer programmer and her method is recognised as the worlds first computer programNote G also contains Lovelaces dismissal of artificial intelligence She wrote that The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform It can follow analysis but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal for example by Alan Turing in his paper Computing Machinery and IntelligenceLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published when he tried to leave his own statement criticising the governments treatment of his Engine as an unsigned preface which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration When Taylors Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Adas involvement and so happily indulged her  because of her celebrated name Their friendship recovered and they continued to correspond On 12 August 1851 when she was dying of cancer Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosophers Walk as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles



==========


In 1840 Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine Luigi Menabrea a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy transcribed Babbages lecture into French and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842
Babbages friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabreas paper into English She then augmented the paper with notes which were added to the translation Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this assisted with input from Babbage These notes which are more extensive than Menabreas paper were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylors Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AALAda Lovelaces notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G In note G she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason The engine was never completed so her program was never testedIn 1953 more than a century after her death Ada Lovelaces notes on Babbages Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to BV Bowdens Faster than Thought A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software

In her notes Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching In her notes she wrote

The Analytical Engine might act upon other things besides number were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engineSupposing for instance that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent
This analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised Walter Isaacson ascribes Lovelaces insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns it reminded her of how Babbages engine used punched cards to make calculations This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley as well as the programmer John GrahamCumming whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine
According to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see In Babbages world his engines were bound by numberWhat Lovelace saw—what Ada Byron saw—was that number could represent entities other than quantity So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers if those numbers represented other things letters musical notes then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance according to rules It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to generalpurpose computation—and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing if we are looking and sifting history for that transition then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper



==========

Though Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer some biographers computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise
Allan G Bromley in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines

All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier The exception was prepared by Babbage for her although she did detect a bug in it Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so
Bruce Collier who later wrote a biography of Babbage wrote in his 1970 Harvard University PhD thesis that Lovelace made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any wayEugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it incorrect to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine although the majority were never published Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840 all substantially predating Lovelaces notes Dorothy K Stein regards Lovelaces notes as more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author the political purposes of the inventor and above all of the social and cultural context in which it was written than a blueprint for a scientific developmentIn his book Idea Makers Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelaces contributions While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelaces notes Wolfram argues that theres nothing as sophisticated—or as clean—as Adas computation of the Bernoulli numbers Babbage certainly helped and commented on Adas work but she was definitely the driver of it Wolfram then suggests that Lovelaces main achievement was to distill from Babbages correspondence a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine—something which Babbage never didDoron Swade a specialist on history of computing known for his work on Babbage analyzed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbages analytical engine

She was a mathematical genius
She made an influential contribution to the analytical engine
She was the first computer programmer
She was a prophet of the computer ageAccording to him only the fourth claim had any substance at all He explained that Ada was only a promising beginner instead of genius in mathematics that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities

1934 FIFA World at FIFAcom
1934 FIFA World at RSSSFcomThe 1936 Summer Olympics German Olympische Sommerspiele 1936 officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad was an international multisport event held in 1936 in Berlin Nazi Germany Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona Spain on 26 April 1931 at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona  It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games
To outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932 Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler had a new 100000seat track and field stadium built as well as six gymnasiums and many other smaller arenas The games were the first to be televised and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for 7 million Her film titled Olympia pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports
Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism and the official Nazi party paper the Völkischer Beobachter wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods – although some women swimmers from the Jewish sports club Hakoah Vienna did take part Jewish athletes from other countries seem to have been sidelined in order not to offend the Nazi regimeTotal ticket revenues were 75 million Reichsmark generating a profit of over one million ℛℳ The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 165 million ℛℳ or outlays of the German national government which did not make its costs public but is estimated to have spent US30 millionJesse Owens won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events and became the most successful athlete to compete in Berlin while Germany was the most successful country overall with 89 medals total with the United States coming in second with 56 medals These were the final Olympics under the presidency of Henri de BailletLatour and the final Olympic Games for 12 years due to the disruption of the Second World War The next Olympic Games were held in 1948 the Winter in Switzerland and then the Summer in London



==========

At the 28th IOC Session held in 1930 in Berlin 14 cities announced their intention to bid to host the 1936 Summer Olympic Games
The bidding for these Olympic Games was the first to be contested by IOC members casting votes for their own favorite host citiesThe vote occurred in 1931 at the 29th IOC Session held in Barcelona that year The vote was held days after the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic and during the final years of the Weimar Republic This was two years before Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in 1933 
By the time of the 1931 IOC Session only Barcelona and Berlin were left in contention for the delegate vote Rome withdrew on the eve of the vote How other candidates withdrew is unclear as is the seriousness of intent behind all the of the listed candidate cities The other cities who announced an intention to hold the games but which withdrew from the race were Alexandria Budapest Buenos Aires Cologne Dublin Frankfurt Helsinki Lausanne Montevideo Nuremberg Rio de Janeiro  and Rome Helsinki Rome Barcelona and Rio de Janeiro would go on to host the Olympic Games in 1952 1960 1992 and 2016 respectivelyThe selection procedure marked the second and final time that the International Olympic Committee would gather to vote in a city which was bidding to host those Games The only other time this occurred was at the inaugural IOC Session in Paris France on 24 April 1894 Then Athens and Paris were chosen to host the 1896 and 1900 Games respectively 
The city of Barcelona held a multisport festival at the same time as the 1931 IOC Session This included a football match between Spain and the Irish Free State which was watched by 70000 spectators The political uncertainty around the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic which had happened days before the IOC Session was likely to have been a greater factor in the decision taken by delegates regarding the host city for 1936 Berlin prevailed 
After the Nazis took control of Germany and began instituting antisemitic policies the IOC held private discussions among its delegates about changing the decision to hold the Games in Berlin However Hitlers regime gave assurances that Jewish athletes would be allowed to compete on a German Olympic team

Hans von Tschammer und Osten as Reichssportführer ie head of the Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen DRL the Reich Sports Office played a major role in the structure and organisation of the Olympics He promoted the idea that the use of sports would harden the German spirit and instill unity among German youth At the same time he also believed that sports was a way to weed out the weak Jewish and other undesirablesVon Tschammer trusted the details of the organisation of the games to Theodor Lewald and Carl Diem the former president and secretary of the Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen the forerunner of the Reich Sports Office Among Diems ideas for the Berlin Games was the introduction of the Olympic torch relay between Greece and the host nation

The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the first of its kind following on from the reintroduction of the Olympic Flame at the 1928 Games It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue Leni Riefenstahl filmed the relay for the 1938 film Olympia

The sportive knightly battle awakens the best human characteristics It doesnt separate but unites the combatants in understanding and respect It also helps to connect the countries in the spirit of peace Thats why the Olympic Flame should never die

Adaptive software development replaces the traditional waterfall cycle with a repeating series of speculate collaborate and learn cycles This dynamic cycle provides for continuous learning and adaptation to the emergent state of the project The characteristics of an ASD life cycle are that it is mission focused feature based iterative timeboxed risk driven and change tolerant As with RAD ASD is also an antecedent to agile software development
The word speculate refers to the paradox of planning – it is more likely to assume that all stakeholders are comparably wrong for certain aspects of the project’s mission while trying to define it During speculation the project is initiated and adaptive cycle planning is conducted
Adaptive cycle planning uses project initiation information—the customer’s
mission statement project constraints eg delivery dates or user descriptions and
basic requirements—to define the set of release cycles software increments that
will be required for the project
Collaboration refers to the efforts for balancing the work based on predictable parts of the environment planning and guiding them and adapting to the uncertain surrounding mix of changes caused by various factors such as technology requirements stakeholders software vendors  The learning cycles challenging all stakeholders are based on the short iterations with design build and testing During these iterations the knowledge is gathered by making small mistakes based on false assumptions and correcting those mistakes thus leading to greater experience and eventually mastery in the problem domain

The 1936 Olympic village is located at Elstal in Wustermark at 52°32′1078″N 13°0′3320″E on the western edge of Berlin The site which is 30 kilometres 19 mi from the centre of the city consisted of one and twofloor dormitories a large dining hall Dining Hall of the Nations a swimming facility gymnasium track and other training facilities Its layout was designed and construction overseen by appointed village commander Hauptmann Wolfgang Fürstner beginning in 1934 Less than two months before the start of the Olympic Games Fürstner was abruptly demoted to vicecommander and replaced by Oberstleutnant Werner von Gilsa commander of the Berlin GuardRegiment The official reason for the replacement was that Fürstner had not acted with the necessary energy to prevent damage to the site as 370000 visitors passed through it between 1 May and 15 June However this was just a cover story to explain the sudden demotion of the halfJewish officer The 1935 Nuremberg Laws passed during the period Fürstner was overseeing the Olympic Village had classified him as a Jew and as such the career officer was to be expelled from the Wehrmacht Two days after the conclusion of the Berlin Olympics vicecommander Fürstner had been removed from active Wehrmacht duty and committed suicide because he realised he had no future under the NazisAfter the completion of the Olympic Games the village was repurposed for the Wehrmacht into the Olympic Döberitz Hospital German OlympiaLazarett Döberitz and Army Infantry School German HeeresInfanterieschule and was used as such through the Second World War In 1945 it was taken over by the Soviet Union and became a military camp of the union occupation forces Late 20th century efforts were made to restore parts of the former village but little progress was made More recently the vast majority of the land of the Olympic village has been managed by the DKB Foundation with more success efforts are being made to restore the site into a living museum The dormitory building used by Jesse Owens Weissen House has been fully restored with the gymnasium and swimming hall partially restored Seasonally tours are given daily to small groups and studentsThe site remains relatively unknown even in Germany but some tournaments are held at the site in an effort to boost knowledge of the venues An effort aimed at 2018 completion is underway to make the village a mixed residential and historical property

Twentytwo venues were used for the 1936 Summer Olympics Many were located in the Reich Sportsfeld complex
Sailing was held in the Bay of Kiel which would serve as the sailing venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich The Olympic Stadium would later be part of two FIFA World Cups and then host an IAAF World Championships in Athletics along with undergoing a renovation in the early 2000s to give new life to the stadium Avus Motor Road AVUS was started in 1907 but was not completed until 1921 due to World War I The track was rebuilt for the 1936 Games AVUS continued being used after World War II though mainly in Formula 2 racing The German Grand Prix was last held at the track in 1959 Dismantling of the track first took place in 1968 to make way for a traffic crossing for touring cars that raced there until 1998BSV 92 Field was first constructed in 1910 for use in football handball athletics and tennis The Reich Sports Field which consisted of the Olympic Stadium the Dietrich Ecekrt OpenAir Theatre the Olympic Swimming Stadium Mayfield the Hockey Stadiums the Tennis Courts and the Haus des Deutschen Sports was planned for the aborted 1916 Summer Olympics but was not completed until 1934 Mayfield was the last venue completed prior to the 1936 Games in April 1936 Deutschland Hall was opened in 1935 Mommenstadion opened in 1930 Basketball was held outdoors at the request of the International Basketball Federation FIBA The tennis courts were used which turned to mud during heavy rain at the final The K1 1000 m canoeing final was also affected by heavy rain at Grünau that included thunder and lightning During World War II Deutschlandhalle suffered heavy aerial bombing damage After the second world war the hall was reconstructed and expansion has continued as of 2010 The Deutschlandhalle in Berlin where the boxing weightlifting and wrestling events took place was used as venue but was increasingly closed for repairs last in 2009 when it was close for repairs It was demolished in December 2011 the Mommsenstadion was renovated in 1987 and was still in use in 2010The Olympic Stadium was used as an underground bunker in World War II as the war went against Nazi Germanys favor The British reopened the Stadium in 1946 and parts of the stadium were rebuilt by the late 1950s As a host venue for the 1974 FIFA World Cup the stadium had its roof partially covered on the North and South Stands British occupation of the stadium ended in 1994 Restoration was approved in 1998 with a contractor being found to do the work in 2000 This restoration ran from 2000 to 2004 The modernized Stadium reopened in 2004 with a capacity of 74228 people The seating has been changed greatly especially the sections that were reserved for German and international political leaders The stadium now plays host to Hertha BSC 1963–present and is expected to remain the home of the team for years to come For the 2006 FIFA World Cup the venue was where the final took place between Italy and France Three years later the venue hosted the World Athletics Championships

As an instructor of mathematics for the women computers at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering Goldstine also trained some of the six women who were the original programmers of ENIAC to manually calculate ballistic trajectories complex differential calculations The job of computer was critical to the war effort and women were regarded as capable of doing the work more rapidly and accurately than men By 1943 and for the balance of World War II essentially all computers were women as were many of their direct supervisors 
She wrote the Operators Manual for the ENIAC after the six women Kay McNulty Betty Jean Jennings Betty Snyder Marlyn Wescoff Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman trained themselves to program the ENIAC using its logical and electrical block diagrams Reconfiguring the machine to solve a different problem involved physically plugging and unplugging wires on the machine it was called settingup as the modern terminology of program had not yet come into useIn 1946 Goldstine sat in on programming sessions with Bartik and Dick Clippinger and was hired to help implement Clippingers stored program modification to the ENIAC John von Neumann was a consultant on the selection of the instruction set implemented  This solved the problem of the programmers having to unplug and replug patch cables for every program the machine was to run instead the program was entered on the three function tables which had previously been used only for storage of a trajectorys drag function ENIAC programmer Jean Bartik called Goldstine one of her three great programming partners along with Betty Holberton and Art Gehring They worked together to program the Taub program for the ENIAC

After the war Goldstine continued her programming work with von Neumann at Los Alamos National Laboratory where she devised problems for ENIAC to process She had two children born in 1952 and 1959 She was diagnosed with cancer in 1962 and died two years later at the age of 43 in 1964

The opening ceremony was held at the Berlin Olympic Stadium A flyover by the German airship Hindenburg flying the Olympic flag behind it was featured early in the opening ceremonies After the arrival of Hitler and his entourage the parade of nations proceeded each nation with its own unique costume As the birthplace of the Olympics Greece entered the stadium first The host nation Germany entered last Some nations athletes purposefully gave the Nazi salute as they passed Hitler Others gave the Olympic salute a similar one given with the same arm or a different gesture entirely such as hatsoverhearts as the United States and China did All nations lowered their flags as they passed the Führer save the United States The United States doing this was explained later as an army regulation Writer Thomas Wolfe who was there described the opening as an almost religious event the crowd screaming swaying in unison and begging for Hitler There was something scary about it his cult of personalityAfter a speech by the president of the German Olympic Committee the games were declared open by Adolf Hitler I proclaim open the Olympic Games of Berlin celebrating the Eleventh Olympiad of the modern era Hitler opened the games from his own box on top of others Writer David Wallechinsky has commented on the event saying This was his event he wanted to be glorifiedAlthough the Olympic flame was first introduced in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam this was the first instance of the torch relay The Nazis invented the concept of the torch run from ancient Olympia to the host city Thus as swimmer Iris Cummings Critchell later related once the athletes were all in place the torch bearer ran in through the tunnel to go around the stadium A young man chosen for this task ran up the steps all the way up to the top of the stadium there to light a cauldron which would start this eternal flame that would burn through the duration of the gamesBut in spite of all the pomp and ceremony and the glorification of Hitler all did not go according to plan and there was a rather humorous aspect in the opening ceremony US distance runner Louis Zamperini one of the athletes present related it on camera

Germany had a prosperous year in the equestrian events winning individual and team gold in all three disciplines as well as individual silver in dressage In the cycling match sprint finals the German Toni Merkens fouled Arie van Vliet of the Netherlands Instead of being disqualified he was fined 100 ℛℳ and kept his gold German gymnasts Konrad Frey and Alfred Schwarzmann both won three gold medals
American Jesse Owens won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events His German competitor Luz Long offered Owens advice after he almost failed to qualify in the long jump and was posthumously awarded the Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship Mack Robinson brother to Jackie Robinson won the 200meter sprint silver medal behind Owens by 04 seconds Although he did not win a medal future American war hero Louis Zamperini lagging behind in the 5000meter final made up ground by clocking a 56second final lap This effort caught the attention of Adolf Hitler who personally commended Zamperini on his speed In one of the most dramatic 800meter races in history American John Woodruff won gold after slowing to jogging speed in the middle of the final in order to free himself from being boxed in Glenn Edgar Morris a farm boy from Colorado won gold in the decathlon Rower Jack Beresford won his fifth Olympic medal in the sport and his third gold medal The US eightman rowing team from the University of Washington won the gold medal coming from behind to defeat the Germans and Italians with Hitler in attendance

Jack Lovelock of New Zealand won the 1500 m gold medal coming through a strong field to win in world record time of 3478
In the marathon the ethnic Koreans Sohn Keechung and Nam Sungyong won one gold and one bronze medal as Korea was annexed by Japan at the time they were running for Japan
India won the gold medal in the field hockey event once again they won the gold in all Olympics from 1928 to 1956 defeating Germany 8–1 in the final However Indians were considered IndoAryans by the Germans and there was no controversy regarding their victory Rie Mastenbroek of the Netherlands won three gold medals and a silver in swimming Estonias Kristjan Palusalu won gold medals in both Mens heavyweight Wrestling styles marking the last time Estonia competed as an independent nation in the Olympics until 1992
After winning the middleweight class the Egyptian weightlifter Khadr El Touni continued to compete for another 45 minutes finally exceeding the total of the German silver medalist by 35 kg The 20yearold El Touni lifted a total of 3875 kg crushing two German world champions El Touni broke the then Olympic and world records while the German lifted 3525 kg Furthermore El Touni had lifted 15 kg more than the lightheavyweight gold medalist a feat only El Touni has accomplished El Tounis new world records stood for 13 years Fascinated by El Tounis performance Adolf Hitler rushed down to greet this human miracle Prior to the competition Hitler was said to have been sure that Rudolf Ismayr and Adolf Wagner would embarrass all other opponents Hitler was so impressed by El Tounis domination in the middleweight class that he ordered a street named after him in Berlins Olympic village The Egyptian held the No 1 position on the IWF list of historys 50 greatest weightlifters for 60 years until the 1996 Games in Atlanta where Turkeys Naim Süleymanoğlu surpassed him to top the list
Italys football team continued their dominance under head coach Vittorio Pozzo winning the gold medal in these Olympics between their two consecutive World Cup victories 1934 and 1938 Much like the successes of German athletes this triumph was claimed by supporters of Benito Mussolinis regime as a vindication of the superiority of the fascist system Austria won the silver a controversial win after Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount Perus 4–2 win over Austria The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games In the quarterfinals of the football tournament Peru beat Austria 4–2 in extratime Peru rallied from a twogoal deficit in the final 15 minutes of normal time During extratime Peruvian fans allegedly ran onto the field and attacked an Austrian player In the chaos Peru scored twice and won 4–2 However Austria protested and the International Olympic Committee ordered a replay without any spectators The Peruvian government refused and their entire Olympic squad left in protest as did ColombiaA remarkable story from the track and field competition was the gold medal won by the US womens 4 × 100 m relay team The German team were the heavy favourites but dropped the baton at one handoff Of notable interest on the US team was Betty Robinson She was the first woman ever awarded an Olympic gold medal for track and field winning the womens 100 m event at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam In 1931 Robinson was involved in a plane crash and was severely injured Her body was discovered in the wreckage and it was wrongly thought that she was dead She was placed in the trunk of a car and taken to an undertaker where it was discovered that she was not dead but in a coma She awoke from the coma seven months later although it was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair and two years before she could walk normally again Due to the length of her recovery she had to miss participating in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in her home country

Iterative and incremental development methods can be traced back as early as 1957 with evolutionary project management and adaptive software development emerging in the early 1970s
During the 1990s a number of lightweight software development methods evolved in reaction to the prevailing heavyweight methods that critics described as overly regulated planned and micromanaged These included rapid application development RAD from 1991 the unified process UP and dynamic systems development method DSDM both from 1994 Scrum from 1995 Crystal Clear and extreme programming XP both from 1996 and featuredriven development from 1997 Although these all originated before the publication of the Agile Manifesto they are now collectively referred to as agile software development methods At the same time similar changes were underway in manufacturing and aerospaceIn 2001 these seventeen software developers met at a resort in Snowbird Utah to discuss these lightweight development methods Kent Beck Ward Cunningham Dave Thomas Jeff Sutherland Ken Schwaber Jim Highsmith Alistair Cockburn Robert C Martin Mike Beedle Arie van Bennekum  Martin Fowler James Grenning Andrew Hunt Ron Jeffries Jon Kern Brian Marick and Steve Mellor Together they published the Manifesto for Agile Software DevelopmentIn 2005 a group headed by Cockburn and Highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles the PM Declaration of Interdependence to guide software project management according to agile software development methods
In 2009 a group working with Martin wrote an extension of software development principles the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto to guide agile software development according to professional conduct and mastery
In 2011 the Agile Alliance created the Guide to Agile Practices renamed the Agile Glossary in 2016 an evolving opensource compendium of the working definitions of agile practices terms and elements along with interpretations and experience guidelines from the worldwide community of agile practitioners

Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy The official Nazi party paper the Völkischer Beobachter wrote in the strongest terms that Jewish people and Black people should not be allowed to participate in the Games However when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations he relented and allowed Black people and Jewish people to participate and added one token participant to the German team—a German woman Helene Mayer who had a Jewish father At the same time the party removed signs stating Jews not wanted and similar slogans from the citys main tourist attractions In an attempt to clean up the host city the German Ministry of the Interior authorized the chief of police to arrest all Romani Gypsies and keep them in a special camp the BerlinMarzahn concentration camp

United States Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage became a main supporter of the Games being held in Germany arguing that politics has no place in sport despite having initial doubtsFrench Olympians gave a Roman salute at the opening ceremony known as the salut de Joinville per the battalion Bataillon de Joinville the Olympic salute was part of the Olympic traditions since the 1924 games However due to the different context this action was mistaken by the crowd for a support to fascism the Olympic salute was discarded after 1946Although Haiti attended only the opening ceremony an interesting vexillological fact was noticed its flag and the flag of Liechtenstein were coincidentally identical and this was not discovered until then The following year a crown was added to Liechtensteins to distinguish one flag from the other
American sprinters Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman the only two Jews on the US Olympic team were pulled from the 4 × 100 relay team on the day of the competition leading to speculation that Brundage did not want to add to Hitlers embarrassment by having two Jews win gold medalsIn 1937 Hollywood released the film Charlie Chan at the Olympics The plot concerned members of the Berlin police force helping the Chinese detective apprehend a group of spies of unnamed nationality trying to steal a new aerial guidance system Despite pertaining to the Berlin Olympics actual Games footage used by the filmmakers was edited to remove any Nazi symbolsAfter the Olympics Jewish participation in German sports was further limited and persecution of Jews started to become ever more lethal The Olympic Games had provided a ninemonth period of relative calmness

Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value
  Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools 
  Working Software over comprehensive documentation 
  Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation 
  Responding to Change over following a plan That is to say the items on the left are valued more than the items on the right
As Scott Ambler elucidated
Tools and processes are important but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively
Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it but the main point of development is to create software not documentation
A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need
A project plan is important but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment stakeholders priorities and peoples understanding of the problem and its solutionSome of the authors formed the Agile Alliance a nonprofit organization that promotes software development according to the manifestos values and principles Introducing the manifesto on behalf of the Agile Alliance Jim Highsmith said

The Agile movement is not antimethodology in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology We want to restore a balance We embrace modeling but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository We embrace documentation but not hundreds of pages of nevermaintained and rarelyused tomes We plan but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as hackers are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker

The German Olympic committee in accordance with Nazi directives virtually barred Germans who were Jewish or Roma or had such an ancestry from participating in the Games Helene Mayer who had one Jewish parent was the only German Jew to compete at the Berlin Games This decision meant exclusion for many of the countrys top athletes such as shotputter and discus thrower Lilli Henoch who was a fourtime world record holder and 10time German national champion and Gretel Bergmann who was suspended from the German team just days after she set a record of 160 meters in the high jumpIndividual Jewish athletes from a number of countries chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics including South African Sid Kiel and Americans Milton Green and Norman Cahners In the United States the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee supported a boycott



==========

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles
Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
Welcome changing requirements even in late development
Deliver working software frequently weeks rather than months
Close daily cooperation between business people and developers
Projects are built around motivated individuals who should be trusted
Facetoface conversation is the best form of communication colocation
Working software is the primary measure of progress
Sustainable development able to maintain a constant pace
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
Best architectures requirements and designs emerge from selforganizing teams
Regularly the team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly

Prior to and during the Games there was considerable debate outside Germany over whether the competition should be allowed or discontinued Berlin had been selected by the IOC as the host city in 1931 but after Adolf Hitlers rise to power in 1933 observers in many countries began to question the morality of going ahead with an Olympic Games hosted by the Nazi regime A number of brief campaigns to boycott or relocate the Games emerged in the United Kingdom France Sweden Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands Exiled German political opponents of Hitlers regime also campaigned against the Berlin Olympics through proCommunist newspapers such as the ArbeiterIllustrierteZeitung
The protests were ultimately unsuccessful in 1935 the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States voted to compete in the Berlin Games and other countries followed suit Fortynine teams from around the world participated in the 1936 Games the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point

Most agile development methods break product development work into small increments that minimize the amount of upfront planning and design Iterations or sprints are short time frames timeboxes that typically last from one to four weeks Each iteration involves a crossfunctional team working in all functions planning analysis design coding unit testing and acceptance testing At the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders This minimizes overall risk and allows the product to adapt to changes quickly An iteration might not add enough functionality to warrant a market release but the goal is to have an available release with minimal bugs at the end of each iteration Multiple iterations might be required to release a product or new features Working software is the primary measure of progress

The Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events since the 1920 Olympics The Soviet government was not invited to the 1920 Games with the Russian Civil War still raging and they did not participate in the 1924 Olympics and forward on ideological grounds Instead through the auspices of the Red Sport International it had participated in a leftwing workers alternative the Spartakiad since 1928 The USSR had intended to attend the Peoples Olympiad in Barcelona until it was cancelled the Soviets did attend the Spartakiadsponsored 1937 Workers Summer Olympiad in Antwerp Belgium The Soviet Union started competing in the Olympics in 1952 when Soviet leaders realized that they can use the event to fulfil their political and ideological agenda



==========

The principle of colocation is that coworkers on the same team should be situated together to better establish the identity as a team and to improve communication This enables facetoface interaction ideally in front of a whiteboard that reduces the cycle time typically taken when questions and answers are mediated through phone persistent chat wiki or emailNo matter which development method is followed every team should include a customer representative Product Owner in Scrum This person is agreed by stakeholders to act on their behalf and makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer questions throughout the iteration At the end of each iteration stakeholders and the customer representative review progress and reevaluate priorities with a view to optimizing the return on investment ROI and ensuring alignment with customer needs and company goals
In agile software development an information radiator is a normally large physical display located prominently near the development team where passersby can see it It presents an uptodate summary of the product development status A build light indicator may also be used to inform a team about the current status of their product development

Traditionally the US sent one of the largest teams to the Olympics and there was a considerable debate over whether the United States should participate in the 1936 GamesThose involved in the debate on whether to boycott the Olympics included Ernest Lee Jahncke Judge Jeremiah Mahoney and future IOC President Avery Brundage Some within the United States considered requesting a boycott of the Games as to participate in the festivity might be considered a sign of support for the Nazi regime and its antisemitic policies However others such as Brundage see below argued that the Olympic Games should not reflect political views but rather should be strictly a contest of the greatest athletes
Avery Brundage then of the United States Olympic Committee opposed the boycott stating that Jewish athletes were being treated fairly and that the Games should continue Brundage asserted that politics played no role in sports and that they should never be entwined Brundage also believed that there was a JewishCommunist conspiracy that existed to keep the United States from competing in the Olympic Games Somewhat ironically Brundage would be later accused of being a Soviet dupe for his controversial stance on the Soviet sports system that allowed them to circumvent the amateur rules On the subject of Jewish discrimination he stated The very foundation of the modern Olympic revival will be undermined if individual countries are allowed to restrict participation by reason of class creed or raceDuring a factfinding trip that Brundage went on to Germany in 1934 to ascertain whether German Jews were being treated fairly Brundage found no discrimination when he interviewed Jews and his Nazi handlers translated for him and Brundage commiserated with his hosts that he belonged to a sports club in Chicago that did not allow Jews entry eitherUnlike Brundage Jeremiah Mahoney supported a boycott of the Games Mahoney the president of the Amateur Athletic Union led newspaper editors and antiNazi groups to protest against American participation in the Berlin Olympics He contested that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich
Most AfricanAmerican newspapers supported participation in the Olympics The Philadelphia Tribune and the Chicago Defender both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed AfricanAmerican pride American Jewish organizations meanwhile largely opposed the Olympics The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation The JLC organized the World Labor Athletic Carnival held on August 15 and 16 at New Yorks Randalls Island to protest the holding of the 1936 Olympics in Nazi GermanyEventually Brundage won the debate convincing the Amateur Athletic Union to close a vote in favor of sending an American team to the Berlin Olympics Mahoneys efforts to incite a boycott of the Olympic games in the United States failed
US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his administration did not become involved in the debate due to a tradition of allowing the US Olympic Committee to operate independently of government influence However several American diplomats including William E Dodd the American ambassador to Berlin and George Messersmith head of the US legation in Vienna deplored the US Olympic Committees decision to participate in the games
FranceFencer Albert Wolff qualified for the French Olympic Team but boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics withdrawing from Frances national team on principle because he was a Jew He said I cannot participate in anything sponsored by Adolf Hitler even for France

Specific tools and techniques such as continuous integration automated unit testing pair programming testdriven development design patterns behaviordriven development domaindriven design code refactoring and other techniques are often used to improve quality and enhance product development agility This is predicated on designing and building quality in from the beginning and being able to demonstrate software for customers at any point or at least at the end of every iteration

Compared to traditional software engineering agile software development mainly targets complex systems and product development with dynamic nondeterministic and nonlinear characteristics Accurate estimates stable plans and predictions are often hard to get in early stages and confidence in them is likely to be low Agile practitioners will seek to reduce the leapoffaith that is needed before any evidence of value can be obtained Requirements and design are held to be emergent Big upfront specifications would probably cause a lot of waste in such cases ie are not economically sound These basic arguments and previous industry experiences learned from years of successes and failures have helped shape agile developments favor of adaptive iterative and evolutionary development

Development methods exist on a continuum from adaptive to predictive Agile software development methods lie on the adaptive side of this continuum One key of adaptive development methods is a rolling wave approach to schedule planning which identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them and also allows for the milestones themselves to changeAdaptive methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities When the needs of a project change an adaptive team changes as well An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future The further away a date is the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week but only which features they plan for next month When asked about a release six months from now an adaptive team might be able to report only the mission statement for the release or a statement of expected value vs cost
Predictive methods in contrast focus on analysing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks In the extremes a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process Predictive methods rely on effective early phase analysis and if this goes very wrong the project may have difficulty changing direction Predictive teams often institute a change control board to ensure they consider only the most valuable changes
Risk analysis can be used to choose between adaptive agile or valuedriven and predictive plandriven methods Barry Boehm and Richard Turner suggest that each side of the continuum has its own home ground as follows



==========

One of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing In the waterfall model there is always a separate testing phase after a build phase however in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming 
Another difference is that traditional waterfall software development moves a project through various Software Development Lifecycle SDLC phases One phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase
Because testing is done in every iteration—which develops a small piece of the software—users can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software they can make better decisions about the softwares future Having a value retrospective and software replanning session in each iteration—Scrum typically has iterations of just two weeks—helps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers This follows a pattern similar to the PDCA cycle as the work is planned done checked in the review and retrospective and any changes agreed are acted upon
This iterative approach supports a product rather than a project mindset This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning making it difficult to change them later Iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirementsBecause of the short iteration style of agile software development it also has strong connections with the lean startup concept

In a letter to IEEE Computer Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development calling it yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering and translating working software over comprehensive documentation as we want to spend all our time coding Remember real programmers dont write documentationThis is disputed by proponents of agile software development who state that developers should write documentation if that is the best way to achieve the relevant goals but that there are often better ways to achieve those goals than writing static documentationScott Ambler states that documentation should be just barely good enough JBGE that too much or comprehensive documentation would usually cause waste and developers rarely trust detailed documentation because its usually out of sync with code while too little documentation may also cause problems for maintenance communication learning and knowledge sharing Alistair Cockburn wrote of the Crystal Clear method 

Crystal considers development a series of cooperative games and intends that the documentation is enough to help the next win at the next game The work products for Crystal include use cases risk list iteration plan core domain models and design notes to inform on choiceshowever there are no templates for these documents and descriptions are necessarily vague but the objective is clear just enough documentation for the next game I always tend to characterize this to my team as what would you want to know if you joined the team tomorrow

In the literature different terms refer to the notion of method adaptation including method tailoring method fragment adaptation and situational method engineering Method tailoring is defined as

A process or capability in which human agents determine a system development approach for a specific project situation through responsive changes in and dynamic interplays between contexts intentions and method fragments

Situationappropriateness should be considered as a distinguishing characteristic between agile methods and more plandriven software development methods with agile methods allowing product development teams to adapt working practices according to the needs of individual products Potentially most agile methods could be suitable for method tailoring such as DSDM tailored in a CMM context and XP tailored with the Rule Description Practices RDP technique Not all agile proponents agree however with Schwaber noting that is how we got into trouble in the first place thinking that the problem was not having a perfect methodology Efforts should center on the changes needed in the enterprise Bas Vodde reinforced this viewpoint suggesting that unlike traditional large methodologies that require you to pick and choose elements Scrum provides the basics on top of which you add additional elements to localise and contextualise its use Practitioners seldom use system development methods or agile methods specifically by the book often choosing to omit or tailor some of the practices of a method in order to create an inhouse methodIn practice methods can be tailored using various tools Generic process modeling languages such as Unified Modeling Language can be used to tailor software development methods However dedicated tools for method engineering such as the Essence Theory of Software Engineering of SEMAT also exist

Agile software development has been widely seen as highly suited to certain types of environments including small teams of experts working on greenfield projects and the challenges and limitations encountered in the adoption of agile software development methods in a large organization with legacy infrastructure are welldocumented and understoodIn response a range of strategies and patterns has evolved for overcoming challenges with largescale development efforts 20 developers or distributed noncolocated development teams amongst other challenges and there are now several recognised frameworks that seek to mitigate or avoid these challenges

Agile software development methods were initially seen as best suitable for noncritical product developments thereby excluded from use in regulated domains such as medical devices pharmaceutical financial nuclear systems automotive and avionics sectors etc However in the last several years there have been several initiatives for the adaptation of agile methods for these domainsThere are numerous standards that may apply in regulated domains including ISO 26262 ISO 9000 ISO 9001 and ISOIEC 15504
A number of key concerns are of particular importance in regulated domains
Quality assurance QA Systematic and inherent quality management underpinning a controlled professional process and reliability and correctness of product
Safety and security Formal planning and risk management to mitigate safety risks for users and securely protecting users from unintentional and malicious misuse
Traceability Documentation providing auditable evidence of regulatory compliance and facilitating traceability and investigation of problems
Verification and Validation VV Embedded throughout the software development process eg user requirements specification functional specification design specification code review unit tests integration tests system tests

Although agile software development methods can be used with any programming paradigm or language in practice they were originally closely associated with objectoriented environments such as Smalltalk and Lisp and later Java The initial adopters of agile methods were usually small to mediumsized teams working on unprecedented systems with requirements that were difficult to finalize and likely to change as the system was being developed This section describes common problems that organizations encounter when they try to adopt agile software development methods as well as various techniques to measure the quality and performance of agile teams



==========

The best agile practitioners have always emphasized thorough engineering principles As a result there are a number of best practices and tools for measuring the performance of agile software development and teams

Organizations and teams implementing agile software development often face difficulties transitioning from more traditional methods such as waterfall development such as teams having an agile process forced on them These are often termed agile antipatterns or more commonly agile smells Below are some common examples

A goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation However this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for reuse are discovered

In agile software development stories similar to use case descriptions are typically used to define requirements and an iteration is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration could be cancelledThis does not mean that a story cannot expand Teams must deal with new information which may produce additional tasks for a story If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration However it should be prioritized against all remaining stories as the new information may have changed the storys original priority

Accusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germanys bid from the very beginning On the very day of the vote a hoax bribery affair was made public leading to calls for a revote On the night before the vote German satirical magazine Titanic sent letters to FIFA representatives offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey who had initially backed England had then been instructed to support South Africa following Englands elimination He abstained citing intolerable pressure on the eve of the vote Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed the vote would have resulted with a 12–12 tie and FIFA president Sepp Blatter who favoured the South African bid would have had to cast the deciding voteMore irregularities surfaced soon after including in the months leading up to the decision the sudden interest of German politicians and major businesses in the four Asian countries whose delegates were decisive for the vote Just a week before the vote the German government under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder lifted their arms embargo on Saudi Arabia and agreed to send grenade launchers to the country DaimlerChrysler invested several hundred million Euro in Hyundai while one of the sons of the companys founders was a member of FIFAs executive committee Both Volkswagen and Bayer announced investments in Thailand and South Korea whose respective delegates Worawi Makudi and Chung JongMoon were possible votes for Germany Makudi additionally received a payment by a company of German media mogul Leo Kirch who also paid millions for usually worthless TV rights for friendly matches of the German team and FC Bayern MunichOn 16 October 2015 the German news magazine Der Spiegel alleged that a slush fund with money from thenAdidas CEO Robert LouisDreyfus was used to influence the vote of four Asian members of the FIFA executive committee The sum of 67 million Euro was later demanded back by Dreyfus In order to retrieve the money the Organizing Committee paid an equivalent sum to the FIFA allegedly as a German share for the cost of a closing ceremony which never materialized Wolfgang Niersbach president of the German Football Association DFB denied the allegations on 17 October 2015 saying that the World Cup was not bought and that he could absolutely and categorically rule out the existence of a slush fund The DFB announced they would consider seeking legal action against Der Spiegel During a press conference on 22 October 2015 Nierbach repeated his stance emphasizing that the 67 million were used in 2002 to secure a subsidy by FIFA According to Niersbach the payment had been agreed upon during a meeting between Franz Beckenbauer and FIFA president Blatter with the money being provided by Dreyfus On the same day FIFA contradicted Niersbachs statement saying By our current state of knowledge no such payment of 10 million Franks was registered by FIFA in 2002 The following day former DFB president Theo Zwanziger publicly accused Niersbach of lying saying It is evident that there was a slush fund for the German World Cup application According to Zwanziger the 67 million Euros went to Mohamed Bin Hammam who at the time was supporting Blatters campaign for president against Issa HayatouOn 22 March 2016 it was announced that the FIFA Ethics Committee was opening proceedings into the bid

The product owner is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding roleA common mistake is to have the product owner role filled by someone from the development team This requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business They try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction This often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration

198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup Germany the host nation was granted automatic qualification with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams Europe five by CAF teams Africa four by CONMEBOL teams South America four by AFC teams Asia and three by CONCACAF teams North and Central America and Caribbean The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC Oceania
Eight nations qualified for the finals for the first time Angola Czech Republic Ghana Ivory Coast Togo Trinidad and Tobago Ukraine and Serbia and Montenegro Czech Republic and Ukraine were making their first appearance as independent nations but had previously been represented as part of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union respectively Serbia and Montenegro had competed as Yugoslavia in 1998 as well as making up part of Yugoslav teams from 1930 to 1990 As of 2018 this was the last time Togo Angola Czech Republic Ukraine and Trinidad and Tobago qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals and the last time Uruguay and Nigeria failed to qualify
Australia qualified for the first time since 1974 Among the teams who failed to qualify were 2002 thirdplaced team Turkey quarterfinalists Senegal Euro 2004 winners Greece and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations winners Egypt Additionally Belgium failed to qualify for the first time since 1978 and Cameroon failed to qualify for the first time since 1986 The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Nigeria who had made the previous three tournaments and Denmark and South Africa who had both qualified for the previous two France had their first successful qualifying campaign since 1986 as they did not qualify for the 1990 and 1994 World Cups in 1998 they were automatically qualified as hosts and in 2002 as defending champions
For the first time since the 1982 World Cup all six confederations were represented at the finals tournament
The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro dissolved prior to the start of the World Cup on 3 June 2006 with Serbia and Montenegro becoming independent countries their team competed at the World Cup unaffected Their involvement in the competition became the first time since the Commonwealth of Independent States appeared at UEFA Euro 1992 a team formed to take the Soviet Unions place following dissolution that multiple sovereign states had been represented in the finals of a major footballing tournament by a single team and the only occurrence in the World Cup finals to date The highest ranked team not to qualify was Denmark ranked 11th while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Togo ranked 61st

Agile software development requires teams to meet product commitments which means they should focus only on work for that product However team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed



==========

The following 32 teams shown with final pretournament rankings qualified for the final tournament



==========
==
Teams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning This is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories Teams should be prepared to move forward only with those stories in which they have confidence then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations often referred to as backlog refinement or grooming

In 2006 Germany had a plethora of football stadia that satisfied FIFAs minimum capacity of 40000 seats for World Cup matches The stillstanding Olympiastadion in Munich 69250 the venue for the 1974 final match was not used for the tournament even though FIFAs regulations allow one city to use two stadia Düsseldorfs LTU Arena 51500 Bremens Weserstadion 43000 and Mönchengladbachs BorussiaPark 46249 were also not used
Twelve stadia were selected to host the World Cup matches During the tournament many of them were known by different names as FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadia unless the stadium sponsors are also official FIFA sponsors For example the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during the competition as FIFA World Cup Stadium Munich German FIFA WMStadion München and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or covered Some of the stadia also had a lower capacity for the World Cup as FIFA regulations ban standing room nonetheless this was accommodated as several stadia had a UEFA fivestar ranking The stadia in Berlin Munich Dortmund and Stuttgart hosted six matches each while the other eight stadia hosted five matches each

A daily standup should be a focused timely meeting where all team members disseminate information If problemsolving occurs it often can only involve certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire teams time If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problemsolving it should be set aside until a subteam can discuss usually immediately after the standup completes

Base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team



==========
==
One of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices as they are closest to the problem Additionally they should make choices as close to implementation as possible to use more timely information in the decision If team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lostBeing assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles for example team member A must always do the database work which limits opportunities for crosstraining Team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide crosstraining opportunities



==========
==
Another common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor While not prohibited by the Scrum methodology the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not working on development tasks A scrum masters role is to facilitate the process rather than create the productHaving the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive Additionally as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity

Squads for the 2006 World Cup consisted of 23 players as in the previous tournament in 2002 Each participating national association had to confirm its 23player squad by 15 May 2006

==
Due to the iterative nature of agile development multiple rounds of testing are often needed Automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit integration and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value workTest automation also supports continued refactoring required by iterative software development Allowing a developer to quickly run tests to confirm refactoring has not modified the functionality of the application may reduce the workload and increase confidence that cleanup efforts have not introduced new defects



==========
==
Focusing on delivering new functionality may result in increased technical debt The team must allow themselves time for defect remediation and refactoring Technical debt hinders planning abilities by increasing the amount of unscheduled work as production defects distract the team from further progressAs the system evolves it is important to refactor as entropy of the system naturally increases Over time the lack of constant maintenance causes increasing defects and development costs

The eight seeded teams for the 2006 tournament were announced on 6 December 2005 The seeds comprised Pot A in the draw Pot B contained the unseeded qualifiers from South America Africa and Oceania Pot C contained eight of the nine remaining European teams excluding Serbia and Montenegro Pot D contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia A special pot contained Serbia and Montenegro this was done to ensure that no group contained three European teams In the special pot Serbia and Montenegro was drawn first then their group was drawn from the three seeded nonEuropean nations Argentina Brazil and Mexico
It had been predetermined that as the host Germany would be placed in Group A thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the draw FIFA had also announced in advance that Brazil the defending champion would be allocated to Group F

On 9 December 2005 the draw was held and the group assignments and order of matches were determined After the draw was completed commentators remarked that Group C appeared to be the group of death while others suggested Group E Argentina and the Netherlands both qualified with a game to spare with wins over Ivory Coast and Serbia and Montenegro respectively



==========
==
A common misconception is that agile software development allows continuous change however an iteration backlog is an agreement of what work can be completed during an iteration Having too much workinprogress WIP results in inefficiencies such as contextswitching and queueing The team must avoid feeling pressured into taking on additional work



==========

The first round or group stage saw the thirtytwo teams divided into eight groups of four teams Each group was a roundrobin of three games where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group Teams were awarded three points for a win one point for a draw and none for a defeat The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16



==========
==
Agile software development fixes time iteration duration quality and ideally resources in advance though maintaining fixed resources may be difficult if developers are often pulled away from tasks to handle production incidents while the scope remains variable The customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration However teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time resources and scope commonly known as the project management triangle Efforts to add scope to the fixed time and resources of agile software development may result in decreased quality



==========
==
If teams were level on points they were ranked on the following criteria in order

Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches
Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches
If teams remained level after those criteria a minigroup would be formed from those teams who would be ranked on
Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie
Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie
Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie
If teams remained level after all these criteria FIFA would hold a drawing of lots
In the original version of the rules for the final tournament the ranking criteria were in a different order with headtohead results taking precedence over total goal difference The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria
In any event the final tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on points Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C Tunisia and Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H Both of these ties were resolved on total goal difference Also in both cases the teams had tied their match so the order of ranking criteria made no difference

The term agile management is applied to an iterative incremental method of managing the design and build activities of engineering information technology and other business areas that aim to provide new product or service development in a highly flexible and interactive manner based on the principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software DevelopmentAgile X techniques may also be called extreme project management It is a variant of iterative life cycle where deliverables are submitted in stages The main difference between agile and iterative development is that agile methods complete small portions of the deliverables in each delivery cycle iteration while iterative methods evolve the entire set of deliverables over time completing them near the end of the project Both iterative and agile methods were developed as a reaction to various obstacles that developed in more sequential forms of project organization For example as technology projects grow in complexity end users tend to have difficulty defining the longterm requirements without being able to view progressive prototypes Projects that develop in iterations can constantly gather feedback to help refine those requirements
Agile management also offers a simple framework promoting communication and reflection on past work amongst team members Teams who were using traditional waterfall planning and adopted the agile way of development typically go through a transformation phase and often take help from agile coaches who help guide the teams through a smooth transformation There are typically two styles of agile coaching pushbased and pullbased agile coaching Agile management approaches have also been employed and adapted to the business and government sectors For example within the federal government of the United States the United States Agency for International Development USAID is employing a collaborative project management approach that focuses on incorporating collaborating learning and adapting CLA strategies to iterate and adapt programmingAgile methods are mentioned in the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBOK Guide under the Project Lifecycle definition

Adaptive project life cycle a project life cycle also known as changedriven or agile methods that is intended to facilitate change and require a high degree of ongoing stakeholder involvement Adaptive life cycles are also iterative and incremental but differ in that iterations are very rapid usually 24 weeks in length and are fixed in time and resources

Although Germany failed to win the Cup the tournament was considered a great success for Germany in general Germany also experienced a sudden increase in patriotic spirit with flag waving traditionally frowned upon by German society since World War II whenever the German team played For the closing ceremonies Matthias Keller composed a work performed simultaneously by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra with conductors Christian Thielemann Zubin Mehta and Mariss Jansons and soloists Diana Damrau Plácido Domingo and Lang Lang

According to JeanLoup Richet Research Fellow at ESSEC Institute for Strategic Innovation  Services this approach can be leveraged effectively for nonsoftware products and for project management in general especially in areas of innovation and uncertainty The end result is a product or project that best meets current customer needs and is delivered with minimal costs waste and time enabling companies to achieve bottom line gains earlier than via traditional approachesAgile software development methods have been extensively used for development of software products and some of them use certain characteristics of software such as object technologies However these techniques can be applied to the development of nonsoftware products such as computers motor vehicles medical devices food clothing and music Agile software development methods have been used in nondevelopment IT infrastructure deployments and migrations Some of the wider principles of agile software development have also found application in general management eg strategy governance risk finance under the terms business agility or agile business management
Under an agile business management model agile software development techniques practices principles and values are expressed across five domains
Integrated customer engagement to embed customers within any delivery process to share accountability for productservice delivery
Facilitationbased management adopting agile management models like the role of Scrum Master to facilitate the daytoday operation of teams
Agile work practices adopting specific iterative and incremental work practices such as Scrum Kanban testdriven development or featuredriven development across all business functions from sales human resources finance and marketing
An enabling organisational structure with a focus on staff engagement personal autonomy and outcomes based governance
Applications of agile process along with DevOps and lean manufacturing to data analytics business intelligence big data and data science is called DataOpsAgile software development paradigms can be used in other areas of life such as raising children Its success in child development might be founded on some basic management principles communication adaptation and awareness In a TED Talk Bruce Feiler shared how he applied basic agile paradigms to household management and raising children

Despite early success by Australia Ecuador and Ghana the tournament marked a return to dominance of the traditional football powers Four years after a 2002 tournament in which teams from North America United States Africa Senegal and Asia South Korea made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and none of the quarterfinalists were from outside Europe or South America Six former champions took part in the quarterfinal round with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runnersup Portugal as the only relative outsiders Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarterfinals leaving an allEuropean final four for only the fourth time after the 1934 1966 and 1982 tournaments

Agile practices can be inefficient in large organizations and certain types of developments Many organizations believe that agile software development methodologies are too extreme and adopt a Hybrid approach  that mixes elements of agile software development and plandriven approaches Some methods such as dynamic systems development method DSDM attempt this in a disciplined way without sacrificing fundamental principles
The increasing adoption of agile practices has also been criticized as being a management fad that simply describes existing good practices under new jargon promotes a one size fits all mindset towards development strategies and wrongly emphasizes method over resultsAlistair Cockburn organized a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in Snowbird Utah on 12 February 2011 gathering some 30+ people who had been involved at the original meeting and since A list of about 20 elephants in the room undiscussable agile topicsissues were collected including aspects the alliances failures and limitations of agile software development practices and context possible causes commercial interests decontextualization no obvious way to make progress based on failure limited objective evidence cognitive biases and reasoning fallacies politics and culture As Philippe Kruchten wrote

The agile movement is in some ways a bit like a teenager very selfconscious checking constantly its appearance in a mirror accepting few criticisms only interested in being with its peers rejecting en bloc all wisdom from the past just because it is from the past adopting fads and new jargon at times cocky and arrogant But I have no doubts that it will mature further become more open to the outside world more reflective and therefore more effective

Despite the early goals that flooded the group stages the knockout phase had a much lower goals per match ratio A prime example of the dearth of goals was Portugal which only scored in the 23rd minute of the Round of 16 and did not score again until the 88th minute of the third place playoff No player managed to score a hattrick in this tournament Italy Germany Argentina Brazil and France were the only teams to score more than one goal in a knockout match Germany was one of the exceptions tending to play an attacking style of football throughout the knockout stage which was reflected by the fact that they scored the most goals 14 with players from all three outfield positions defence midfield and forward making the scoresheet
Germanys Miroslav Klose scored five goals to claim the Golden Boot the lowest total to win the prize since 1962 No other player scored more than three goals No player from the winning Italian squad scored more than two goals though ten players had scored for the team tying Frances record in 1982 for the most goalscorers from any one team
For the first time ever in the FIFA World Cup the first and last goals of the tournament were scored by defenders Philipp Lahm the German left wingback scored the opener against Costa Rica after only 5 minutes of the opening match In the final Marco Materazzi the Italian centre back outjumped Patrick Vieira and headed in the last goal of the 2006 FIFA World Cup

The tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup Players received a recordbreaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarterfinal and semifinal matches respectively FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final should their teams make it that far The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatias Josip Šimunić in their match against Australia
The high number of yellow and red cards shown also prompted discussion about the referees FIFA Officials and President Sepp Blatter received criticism for allegedly making rules too rigid and taking discretion away from referees

In the opening match of the tournament Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4–2 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournaments history Germany went on to win the Group A after edging Poland and breezing past Ecuador 3–0 Despite the defeat Ecuador had already joined the host in the Round of 16 having beaten Poland and Costa Rica 2–0 and 3–0 respectively



==========


The only biographical information known about him is contained in his famed Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices Like his father before him he served as chief engineer at the Artuklu Palace the residence of the Mardin branch of the Artuqids which ruled across eastern Anatolia as vassals of the Zengid dynasty of Mosul and later of Ayyubid general SaladinAlJazari was part of a tradition of artisans and was thus more a practical engineer than an inventor who appears to have been more interested in the craftsmanship necessary to construct the devices than in the technology which lay behind them and his machines were usually assembled by trial and error rather than by theoretical calculation His Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices appears to have been quite popular as it appears in a large number of manuscript copies and as he explains repeatedly he only describes devices he has built himself According to Mayr the books style resembles that of a modern doityourself bookSome of his devices were inspired by earlier devices such as one of his monumental water clocks which was based on that of a PseudoArchimedes He also cites the influence of the Banū Mūsā brothers for his fountains alSaghani for the design of a candle clock and Hibatullah ibn alHusayn d 1139 for musical automata AlJazari goes on to describe the improvements he made to the work of his predecessors and describes a number of devices techniques and components that are original innovations which do not appear in the works by his precessors



==========
==

In Group B England and Sweden pushed Paraguay into third place after narrow victories over the South Americans Trinidad and Tobago earned some international respect after a draw with Sweden in their opening game and managing to hold England scoreless for 83 minutes until goals from Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard sealed a 2–0 win for the Three Lions Sweden qualified for the knockout rounds after drawing 2–2 with England to maintain their 38year unbeaten record against them



==========

The most significant aspect of alJazaris machines are the mechanisms components ideas methods and design features which they employ



==========
==

Both Argentina and Netherlands qualified from Group C with a game remaining Argentina topping the group on goal difference having hammered Serbia and Montenegro 6–0 and beating Ivory Coast 2–1 The Dutch picked up 1–0 and 2–1 victories over Serbia and Montenegro and Ivory Coast respectively Ivory Coast defeated Serbia and Montenegro 3–2 in their final game in Serbia and Montenegros last ever international as the country had dissolved 18 days earlier



==========

A camshaft a shaft to which cams are attached was introduced in 1206 by alJazari who employed them in his automata water clocks such as the candle clock and waterraising machines The cam and camshaft also appeared in European mechanisms from the 14th century



==========
==

Portugal coasted through in Group D picking up the maximum number of points with Mexico qualifying in second Iran missed chances against Mexico in their opening 1–3 defeat and were eliminated in their match against Portugal They fought hard against the Portuguese but went down 2–0 Their last game against Angola ended in 1–1 draw The Africans had a respectable first World Cup tournament after earning draws with Mexico 0–0 and Iran



==========

The eccentrically mounted handle of the rotary quernstone in fifth century BCE Spain that spread across the Roman Empire constitutes a crank The earliest evidence of a crank and connecting rod mechanism dates to the 3rd century AD Hierapolis sawmill in the Roman Empire The crank also appears in the mid9th century in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their Book of Ingenious DevicesIn 1206 alJazari invented an early crankshaft which he incorporated with a crankconnecting rod mechanism in his twincylinder pump Like the modern crankshaft alJazaris mechanism consisted of a wheel setting several crankpins into motion with the wheels motion being circular and the pins moving backandforth in a straight line The crankshaft described by alJazari transforms continuous rotary motion into a linear reciprocating motion and is central to modern machinery such as the steam engine internal combustion engine and automatic controlsHe used the crankshaft with a connecting rod in two of his waterraising machines the crankdriven saqiya chain pump and the doubleaction reciprocating piston suction pump His water pump also employed the first known crankslider mechanism



==========
==

In Group E Italy went through to the Round of 16 conceding just one goal an own goal in the group phase against the United States The US bowed out of the tournament after disappointing results against the Czech Republic and Ghana 0–3 and 1–2 respectively despite a 1–1 draw finishing with 9 vs 10 men against Italy Tournament debutant Ghana joined Italy in the round of 16 following victories over the Czech Republic and the United States Daniele De Rossi was suspended for 4 games following his sendingoff against the United States



==========

English technology historian Donald Hill writes

We see for the first time in alJazaris work several concepts important for both design and construction the lamination of timber to minimize warping the static balancing of wheels the use of wooden templates a kind of pattern the use of paper models to establish designs the calibration of orifices the grinding of the seats and plugs of valves together with emery powder to obtain a watertight fit and the casting of metals in closed mold boxes with sand



==========
==

Group F included the reigning World Champions Brazil Croatia Japan and Australia Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3–1 and despite losing 0–2 to Brazil a 2–2 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sentoff for second bookings and one erroneously for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the firsthalf by Kaká Croatia and Japan went out of the tournament without a single win



==========

AlJazari invented a method for controlling the speed of rotation of a wheel using an escapement mechanism



==========
==

France only managed a scoreless draw against Switzerland and a 1–1 draw against South Korea With captain Zinedine Zidane suspended their 2–0 win against Togo was enough for them to advance to the knockout round They were joined by the group winners Switzerland who defeated South Korea 2–0 and did not concede a goal in the tournament South Korea won their first World Cup finals match outside their own country in defeating Togo but four points were not enough to see them through to the round of 16 the only team for which this was the case while Togo exited without a point



==========

According to Donald Hill alJazari described several early mechanical controls including a large metal door a combination lock and a lock with four bolts



==========
==

Spain dominated Group H picking up the maximum number of points scoring 8 goals and conceding only 1 Ukraine despite being beaten 4–0 by Spain in their first World Cup game took advantage of the weaker opponents to beat Saudi Arabia 4–0 and scrape past Tunisia 1–0 thanks to a 70thminute penalty by Andriy Shevchenko to reach the Round of 16 Saudi Arabia and Tunisia went out of the tournament having 1 point each thanks to a 2–2 draw against each other



==========

A segmental gear is a piece for receiving or communicating reciprocating motion from or to a cogwheel consisting of a sector of a circular gear or ring having cogs on the periphery or face Professor Lynn Townsend White Jr wrote

Segmental gears first clearly appear in alJazari in the West they emerge in Giovanni de Dondis astronomical clock finished in 1364 and only with the great Sienese engineer Francesco di Giorgio 1501 did they enter the general vocabulary of European machine design



==========


The knockout stage involved the sixteen teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament There were four rounds of matches with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round The successive rounds were round of 16 quarterfinals semifinals and final There was also a playoff to decide thirdfourth place For each game in the knockout stage a draw was followed by thirty minutes of extra time two 15minute halves if scores were still level there would be a penalty shootout at least five penalties each and more if necessary to determine who progressed to the next round Scores after extra time are indicated by aet and penalty shootouts are indicated by pen



==========


AlJazari invented five machines for raising water as well as watermills and water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata in the 12th and 13th centuries and described them in 1206 It was in these waterraising machines that he introduced his most important ideas and components



==========
==
In the second round conceding two early goals in the first twelve minutes to Germany effectively ended the Swedes hopes of progressing to the quarterfinals Argentina struggled to get past Mexico until a Maxi Rodríguez goal in extra time put the Albiceleste in the quarterfinals Australias journey ended when Italians were awarded a controversial penalty scored by Francesco Totti deep into the remaining seconds of the match The Italians had spent much of the game with only ten men on the field following an equally controversial red card shown to centre back Marco Materazzi In a 0–0 match Switzerland failed to convert any of their three penalties in the penalty shootout against Ukraine to see them exit the competition with an unwanted new record in becoming the first team in a World Cup to fail to convert any penalties in a shootout Their elimination also meant that they became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals and indeed the only nation ever to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal
England struggled against Ecuador but won 1–0 thanks to a David Beckham free kick Brazil won 3–0 against Ghana in a game which included Ronaldos record 15th World Cup goal Der Spiegel reported that the match may have been influenced by an Asian betting syndicate Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0 The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match which marked a new World Cup record with 16 yellow cards Portugal 9 the Netherlands 7 and 4 players being sent off for a second bookable offence France came from behind to defeat Spain 3–1 thanks to goals from Franck Ribéry Patrick Vieira and Zinedine Zidane



==========

The first known use of a crankshaft in a chain pump was in one of alJazaris saqiya machines The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of alJazaris saqiya chain pumps which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump AlJazari also constructed a waterraising saqiya chain pump which was run by hydropower rather than manual labour though the Chinese were also using hydropower for chain pumps prior to him Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying water in Damascus since the 13th century up until modern times and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world



==========
==
Germany and Argentina ended 1–1 after extra time the hosts edged out the Argentinians 4–2 on penalties to go through to the semifinals this was the first time Argentina had lost a World Cup penalty shootout up until this match both Argentina and Germany had participated in three penalty shootouts winning all of them In Gelsenkirchen when England faced Portugal Wayne Rooney was sent off and Portugal won the penalty shootout 3–1 after a 0–0 draw to reach their first World Cup semifinal since the days of Eusébio 40 years earlier and ensure manager Luiz Felipe Scolaris third consecutive tournament quarterfinal win over SvenGöran Erikssons EnglandItaly defeated quarterfinal debutants Ukraine 3–0 France eliminated Brazil 1–0 to advance into the semifinals Brazil only managed one shot on goal while Zinedine Zidanes dribbling earned him Man of the Match and his freekick to Thierry Henry resulted in the winning goal



==========

Citing the Byzantine siphon used for discharging Greek fire as an inspiration alJazari went on to describe the first suction pipes suction pump doubleaction pump and made early uses of valves and a crankshaftconnecting rod mechanism when he invented a twincylinder reciprocating piston suction pump This pump is driven by a water wheel which drives through a system of gears an oscillating slotrod to which the rods of two pistons are attached The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders each provided with valveoperated suction and delivery pipes The delivery pipes are joined above the centre of the machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system This waterraising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering This pump is remarkable for three reasons
The first known use of a true suction pipe which sucks fluids into a partial vacuum in a pump
The first application of the doubleacting principle
The conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion via the crankconnecting rod mechanismAlJazaris suction piston pump could lift 136 metres of water with the help of delivery pipes This was more advanced than the suction pumps that appeared in 15thcentury Europe which lacked delivery pipes It was not however any more efficient than the noria commonly used by the Muslim world at the time



==========
==
With Argentina and Brazil eliminated in the quarterfinals an allEuropean semifinal line up was completed for only the fourth time after the 1934 1966 and 1982 tournaments
The semifinal between Germany and Italy produced an extra time period that went scoreless until the 118th minute when Italy scored twice through Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero putting an end to Germanys undefeated record in Dortmund 
In the second semifinal Portugal lost to France 1–0 in Munich In a repeat of the Euro 1984 and Euro 2000 semifinals Portugal were defeated by France with the decisive goal being a penalty scored by France captain Zinedine Zidane



==========

alJazari developed the earliest water supply system to be driven by gears and hydropower which was built in 13th century Damascus to supply water to its mosques and Bimaristan hospitals The system had water from a lake turn a scoopwheel and a system of gears which transported jars of water up to a water channel that led to mosques and hospitals in the city



==========
==
The hosts got three goals in 20 minutes in the second half with the help of 21yearold left midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger His first goal beat the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo with pace over his head Only 4 minutes later Schweinsteigers free kick 30 metres from the left of the penalty box driven low across goal was connected with Petits knee to become an own goal for Portugal The German did not stop and netted his second goal which swerved away to the keepers left in the 78th minute
Portugal were strong in possession but lacked punch in attack unable to convert 57 possession into goals Pauleta had two clear chances from 15 metres but both times hit tame shots that did not trouble keeper Oliver Kahn who was playing in his last match for the German national team Portugal got a consolation goal with the help of substitute Luís Figo also playing the final international game of his career who almost immediately provided the precise distribution needed to unlock the German defence A cross from the right wing on 88 minutes found fellow substitute Nuno Gomes at the far post who dived in for the goal The game ended 3–1 a result which gave the tournament hosts the bronze medals and left Portugal in fourth place



==========

AlJazari built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower He also invented the earliest known automatic gates which were driven by hydropower created automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate water clocks and invented water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata According to Encyclopædia Britannica the Italian Renaissance inventor Leonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of alJazariMark E Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Muslim engineers especially alJazari as follows

Unlike the Greek designs these Arab examples reveal an interest not only in dramatic illusion but in manipulating the environment for human comfort Thus the greatest contribution the Arabs made besides preserving disseminating and building on the work of the Greeks was the concept of practical application This was the key element that was missing in Greek robotic science
The Arabs on the other hand displayed an interest in creating humanlike machines for practical purposes but lacked like other preindustrial societies any real impetus to pursue their robotic science



==========

The final started with each side scoring within the first 20 minutes Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring by converting a controversial seventhminute penalty kick which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and bounced beyond the goal line before it spun back up hit the crossbar again and rebounded out of the goal Marco Materazzi then levelled the scores in the 19th minute following an Andrea Pirlo corner Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in normal time Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy he later had a header disallowed for offside while France were not awarded a possible second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta
At the end of the regulation 90 minutes the score was still level at 1–1 and the match was forced into extra time Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon made a potentially gamesaving save in extra time when he tipped a Zidane header over the crossbar Further controversy ensued near the end of extra time when Zidane headbutted Materazzi in the chest in an offtheball incident and was sent off Extra time produced no further goals and a penalty shootout followed which Italy won 5–3 Frances David Trezeguet the man who scored the golden goal against Italy in Euro 2000 was the only player not to score his penalty his spot kick hit the crossbar landed on the goal line and went out It was the first allEuropean final since Italys triumph over West Germany in the 1982 World Cup and the second final after 1994 to be decided on penalties It was also Italys first world title in 24 years and their fourth overall making them the second most successful World Cup team ever The victory also helped Italy top the FIFA World Rankings in February 2007 for the first time since November 1993



==========

One of alJazaris humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve water tea or drinks The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and after seven minutes into a cup after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink



==========

AlJazari invented a hand washing automaton incorporating a flush mechanism now used in modern flush toilets It features a female humanoid automaton standing by a basin filled with water When the user pulls the lever the water drains and the female automaton refills the basin



==========

Miroslav Klose received the Golden Boot for scoring five goals in the World Cup In total 147 goals were scored by 110 players with four of them credited as own goals

5 goals Miroslav Klose3 goals
2 goals
1 goal
Own goals Cristian Zaccardo against the United States
 Carlos Gamarra against England
 Petit against Germany
 Brent Sancho against Paraguay



==========

AlJazaris peacock fountain was a more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and towels Mark E Rosheim describes it as follows
Pulling a plug on the peacocks tail releases water out of the beak as the dirty water from the basin fills the hollow base a float rises and actuates a linkage which makes a servant figure appear from behind a door under the peacock and offer soap When more water is used a second float at a higher level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure – with a towel



==========

FIFAs Technical Study Group TSG also granted a Man of the Match award to one player in each match Italys Andrea Pirlo won the most Man of the Match awards with three in total Miroslav Klose Agustin Delgado Arjen Robben Zé Roberto Alexander Frei Michael Ballack and Patrick Vieira each received two awards



==========


AlJazaris work described fountains and musical automata in which the flow of water alternated from one large tank to another at hourly or halfhourly intervals This operation was achieved through his innovative use of hydraulic switchingAlJazari created a musical automaton which was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties Professor Noel Sharkey has argued that it is quite likely that it was an early programmable automata and has produced a possible reconstruction of the mechanism it has a programmable drum machine with pegs cams that bump into little levers that operated the percussion The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around



==========

The Allstar team is a squad consisting of the 23 most impressive players at the 2006 World Cup as selected by FIFAs Technical Study Group The team was chosen from a shortlist of over 50 players and was selected based on performances from the second round onwards



==========

AlJazari constructed a variety of water clocks and candle clocks These included a portable waterpowered scribe clock which was a meter high and half a meter wide reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum in 1976 AlJazari also invented monumental waterpowered astronomical clocks which displayed moving models of the Sun Moon and stars



==========

CHF245 million – Winner



==========


According to Donald Hill alJazari described the most sophisticated candle clocks known to date Hill described one of alJazaris candle clocks as follows
The candle whose rate of burning was known bore against the underside of the cap and its wick passed through the hole Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight As the candle burned away the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known

AlJazaris candle clock also included a dial to display the time and for the first time employed a bayonet fitting a fastening mechanism still used in modern times



==========

All 32 teams are ranked based on criteria which have been used by FIFA A penalty shootout counts as a draw for both teams



==========


The elephant clock described by alJazari in 1206 is notable for several innovations It was the first clock in which an automaton reacted after certain intervals of time in this case a humanoid robot striking the cymbal and a mechanical robotic bird chirping and the first water clock to accurately record the passage of the temporal hours to match the uneven length of days throughout the year



==========

The sponsors of the 2006 World Cup consisted of 15 FIFA Partners



==========


AlJazaris largest astronomical clock was the castle clock which was a complex device that was about 11 feet 34 m high and had multiple functions besides timekeeping It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits and an innovative feature of the device was a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway moved by a hidden cart and caused automatic doors to open each revealing a mannequin every hour Another innovative feature was the ability to reprogram the length of day and night in order to account for their changes throughout the year
Another feature of the device was five automata musicians who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float a float chamber and flow regulator plate and valve trough two pulleys crescent disc displaying the zodiac and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases AlJazaris castle clock is considered to be the earliest programmable analog computer

==========


Sri Lanka qualified for the knockouts with a secondplace finish in Group A They won four of their six games suffered a defeat against Pakistan and against Australia was washed out Being level on points with Australia they were placed second in the group due to their better net run rate
India were drawn in Group B where they finished second behind South Africa They managed wins in four of their six games lost one against South Africa while their game against England was a high scoring tie
Sri Lanka had clinically demolished England in the quarter final defeating them by 10 wickets Both the Sri Lankan openers Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga made unbeaten centuries and put up a worldrecord stand for the first wicket in a World Cup The New Zealand semifinal was more keenly contested but was still won with relative ease by Sri Lanka The matches showcased the effective unconventional bowling of pace spearhead Lasith Malinga restrictive fielding and the batting prowess of the Sri Lankan top order
Both of Indias knockout matches were highpressure contests Australia was a strong team and the defending champions and India had to give a very good performance to restrict Australia to 260 and then successfully chase down the target even as wickets fell regularly Pakistan and India have historically been rivals and there was immense public pressure on both teams The match was attended by the Prime Ministers of both India and Pakistan India batted first and ultimately defeated Pakistan by 29 runs

India largely retained the same team it had in the semifinal against Pakistan with just one change Ashish Nehra leftarm medium pacer had suffered a finger fracture while fielding in that match and he was replaced by another pacer Sreesanth India was widely rated as having the strongest batting lineup in the tournament and chose to back this strength throughout the campaign by playing seven batsmen and four bowlers Due to Yuvraj Singh performing well with both bat and ball in the tournament India could afford to play with only four specialist bowlers Yuvraj bowled his full quota of 10 overs in many matches including the semifinal against Pakistan Among the four bowling slots Zaheer Khan was the pace spearhead supported in most matches by Munaf Patel while Harbhajan Singh was the regular offspinner The fourth slot was taken by different bowlers in different matches including Sreesanth Nehra legspinner Piyush Chawla or offspinner Ravichandran Ashwin The captain had chosen Nehra over Ashwin in the match against Pakistan also Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had then said he preferred having three seamers because it gave him more options He already had proven spinners in Harbhajan and Yuvraj and could call upon many other Indian players who can bowl parttime spin including Sachin Tendulkar Suresh Raina and Virender Sehwag
Sri Lanka made four changes to their side from the semifinal Allrounder Angelo Mathews had suffered a torn quadriceps and could not play Sri Lanka knew the Indians strength was batting and thus they needed to take wickets to put them under pressure This led to their choosing a full complement of bowlers Spin bowler Ajantha Mendis had performed well throughout the tournament but he had a poor record against India in preWorld Cup clashes and was not chosen for the final Spinner Rangana Herath was also dropped Offspinner Suraj Randiv and batsman Chamara Kapugedera were flown in from Sri Lanka to strengthen the side Seamers Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera who had played matches in the earlier group stage were drafted into the team Legendary spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was carrying minor injuries but was retained He had announced that he would retire from One Day International cricket after the World Cup so this was his last match The semifinal held at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo was his last ODI match on home soil and there he had been carried around the stadium perched on his teammates shoulders on a lap of honour after that match

In an interview on education in America with the Davis Group Ltd Kay said

I had the fortune or misfortune to learn how to read fluently starting at the age of three So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me
Originally from Springfield Massachusetts Kays family relocated several times due to his fathers career in physiology before ultimately settling in the New York metropolitan area when he was nine
He attended the prestigious Brooklyn Technical High School where he was suspended due to insubordination in his senior year Having already accumulated enough credits to graduate Kay then attended Bethany College in Bethany West Virginia He majored in biology and minored in mathematics before he was asked to leave by the administration for protesting the institutions Jewish quota
Thereafter Kay taught guitar in Denver Colorado for a year and hastily enlisted in the United States Air Force when the local draft board inquired about his nonstudent status Assigned as a computer programmer a rare billet dominated by women due to the secretarial connotations of the field in the era after passing an aptitude test he devised an early crossplatform file transfer system
Following his discharge Kay enrolled at the University of Colorado Boulder earning a bachelors degree in mathematics and molecular biology in 1966 Before and during this time he worked as a professional jazz guitarist During his studies at CU he wrote the music for an adaptation of The Hobbit and other campus theatricalsIn the autumn of 1966 he began graduate school at the University of Utah College of Engineering He earned an MS in electrical engineering in 1968 before taking his PhD in computer science in 1969 His doctoral dissertation FLEX A Flexible Extendable Language described the invention of a computer language known as FLEX While there he worked with fathers of computer graphics David C Evans who had been recently recruited from the University of California Berkeley to start Utahs computer science department and Ivan Sutherland best known for writing such pioneering programs as Sketchpad Their mentorship greatly inspired Kays evolving views on objects and programming As he grew busier with DARPA research he ended his musical career
In 1968 he met Seymour Papert and learned of the Logo programming language a dialect of Lisp optimized for educational purposes This led him to learn of the work of Jean Piaget Jerome Bruner Lev Vygotsky and of constructionist learning further influencing his professional orientation
Leaving Utah as an associate professor of computer science in 1969 Kay became a visiting researcher at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in anticipation of accepting a professorship at Carnegie Mellon University Instead in 1970 he joined the Xerox PARC research staff in Palo Alto California Throughout the decade he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language Smalltalk These inventions were later commercialized by Apple in their Lisa and Macintosh computers
Kay is one of the fathers of the idea of objectoriented programming which he named along with some colleagues at PARC Some of the original objectoriented concepts including the use of the words object and class had been developed for Simula 67 at the Norwegian Computing Center Later he said

Im sorry that I long ago coined the term objects for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the  lesser idea The big idea is messaging
While at PARC Kay conceived the Dynabook concept a key progenitor of laptop and tablet computers and the ebook He is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface GUI Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform Kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the One Laptop Per Child educational platform with which Kay is actively involved
The field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen according to Kay in which educational communities parents and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by Douglas Engelbart but a medium in the Marshall McLuhan sense He wrote

As with Simulas leading to OOP this encounter finally hit me with what the destiny of personal computing really was going to be Not a personal dynamic vehicle as in Engelbarts metaphor opposed to the IBM railroads but something much more profound a personal dynamic medium With a vehicle one could wait until high school and give drivers ed but if it was a medium it had to extend into the world of childhood

From 1981 to 1984 Kay was Ataris Chief Scientist He became an Apple Fellow in 1984 Following the closure of the companys Advanced Technology Group in 1997 he was recruited by his friend Bran Ferren head of research and development at Disney to join Walt Disney Imagineering as a Disney Fellow He remained there until Ferren left to start Applied Minds Inc with Imagineer Danny Hillis leading to the cessation of the Fellows program In 2001 he founded Viewpoints Research Institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to children learning and advanced software development  For its first ten years Kay and his Viewpoints group were based at Applied Minds in Glendale California where he and Ferren continued to work together on various projects Kay was also a Senior Fellow at HewlettPackard until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20 2005
Kay taught a Fall 2011 class Powerful Ideas Useful Tools to Understand the World at New York Universitys Interactive Telecommunications Program ITP along with fulltime ITP faculty member Nancy Hechinger The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teachinglearning based on fundamental powerful concepts rather than traditional rote learning

Sri Lanka started the innings slowly constrained by good bowling from Zaheer Khan and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli inside the 30yard circle Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Upul Tharanga conceding only six runs in his fiveover spell Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan Singh when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves Captain Kumara Sangakkara came in after Tharangas dismissal and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed Mahela Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 602 in the 17th over Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48 New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out Chamara Kapugedera who was playing his first World Cup match was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan Jayawardene meanwhile continued with his quality batting ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a highclass batting display Helped by the hardhitting of Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs including 63 in the batting powerplay 45–50 overs to take the score to 2746

India had a shaky start with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar both dismissed early by Lasith Malinga leaving them struggling at 31 for two Sehwag was trapped LBW for a duck on the second ball of the innings Tendulkar started with some good strokes racing to 18 off 14 balls but then edged a catch to wicketkeeper Sangakkara Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets taking India to 114 before Kohli was caughtandbowled by Tillakaratne Dilshan for 35 When he was on 30 Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv sending the ball high up in the air but Nuwan Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83run partnership before Kohlis dismissal Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five usually the position of Yuvraj Singh Both Kohli and Dhoni are righthanded batsmen while Gambhir and Yuvraj are lefthanded Along with other considerations by coming ahead of Yuvraj Dhoni ensured there would be a rightleft batting combination between him and Gambhir which makes it difficult for the bowlers to get into a rhythm and necessitates frequent field changes Both Gambhir and Dhoni emphasised on preserving the wickets and later accelerating with a greater flow of boundaries Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97 Gambhir tried to finish his century with a boundary but his heaving bat failed to connect with the ball and he was bowled by Thisara Perera Following Gambhirs dismissal 52 runs were required off 52 balls Yuvraj Singh was the new batsman and along with Dhoni
took India to victory and Dhoni sealed the match hitting a six off Nuwan Kulasekarawhen only 4 runs were required off 11 balls Dhoni finished on 91 not out from 79 deliveries Like in many other daynight matches in the subcontinent dew started to form on the outfield grass in the night making the ball damp and difficult to grip especially in the later part of Indias batting However this was a known factor and was taken into consideration by the Sri Lankan captain when he chose to bat first after winning the toss By crossing the target of 274 India had set a record for the highest successful runchase in a World Cup finalAt the end of the match the batting strength of both the teams stood out The three top run scorers of this tournament were from these finalists Tillekaratne Dilshan 500 runs Sachin Tendulkar 482 and Kumar Sangakkara 465 In the top 10 tournament scorers there were 3 from Sri Lanka Upul Tharanga 395 in addition to the previous two and 4 from India Gautam Gambhir 393 Virender Sehwag 380 and Yuvraj Singh 362 in addition to Sachin

In the postmatch presentation the Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara said that the Indians batted very well and looks like you need to make something like 350 runs to put them under pressure The then Indian captain MS Dhoni said that he had added motivation to play well to justify some unexpected decisions he had made for this match like playing Sreesanth instead of Ashwin and promoting himself up the order above Yuvraj MS Dhoni was named Man of the Match for his powerful and matchwinning batting display under pressure Yuvraj Singh was named Man of the Tournament for good allround performance with both bat and ball throughout the tournament
After the presentation an ecstatic Indian team first held the Cup amid showers of champagne and confetti Some Indian players including Harbhajan Singh Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh had tears in their eyes The team then carried iconic player Tendulkar on a victory lap around the stadium Coach Gary Kirsten was also carried around the ground later The Indian players dedicated their victory to Tendulkar Virat Kohli said he has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years It is time we carried him on our shoulders Gautam Gambhir dedicated the victory to the victims of the 2611 Mumbai attacks and to the soldiers guarding Indias bordersCelebrations went on through the night in the team hotel The victory prompted several firework displays and celebrations throughout India In Sri Lanka however there were only a few firework displays

Kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented  Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk entitled The Computer Revolution Hasnt Happened Yet were informed by his experiences with Sketchpad Simula Smalltalk and the bloated code of commercial software
On August 31 2006 Kays proposal to the United States National Science Foundation NSF was granted thus funding Viewpoints Research Institute for several years The proposal title was STEPS Toward the Reinvention of Programming A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Selfexploratorium A sense of what Kay is trying to do comes from this quote from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs Berkeley The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days We wonder how small could be an understandable practical Model T design that covers this functionality 1M lines of code 200K LOC 100K LOC 20K LOC

Viewpoints Research Institute
Alan Kay at TEDIn mathematics and computer science an algorithm  listen is a set of instructions typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation data processing automated reasoning and other tasks
As an effective method an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a welldefined formal language for calculating a function Starting from an initial state and initial input perhaps empty the instructions describe a computation that when executed proceeds through a finite number of welldefined successive states eventually producing output and terminating at a final ending state The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic some algorithms known as randomized algorithms incorporate random inputThe concept of algorithm has existed for centuries Greek mathematicians used algorithms in the sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbersThe word algorithm itself is derived from the 9th century mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā alKhwārizmī Latinized Algoritmi A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem decision problem posed by David Hilbert in 1928 Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define effective calculability or effective method Those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930 1934 and 1935 Alonzo Churchs lambda calculus of 1936 Emil Posts Formulation 1 of 1936 and Alan Turings Turing machines of 1936–37 and 1939

The word algorithm has its roots in Latinizing the name of Muhammad ibn Musa alKhwarizmi in a first step to algorismus AlKhwārizmī Arabic الخوارزمي‎  Persian خوارزمی‎ c 780–850 was a Persian  mathematician astronomer geographer and scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad whose name means the native of Khwarazm a region that was part of Greater Iran and is now in UzbekistanAbout 825 alKhwarizmi wrote an Arabic language treatise on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system which was translated into Latin during the 12th century under the title Algoritmi de numero Indorum This title means Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians where Algoritmi was the translators Latinization of AlKhwarizmis name AlKhwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages primarily through another of his books the Algebra In late medieval Latin algorismus English algorism the corruption of his name simply meant the decimal number system In the 15th century under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός number cf arithmetic the Latin word was altered to algorithmus and the corresponding English term algorithm is first attested in the 17th century the modern sense was introduced in the 19th centuryIn English it was first used in about 1230 and then by Chaucer in 1391 English adopted the French term but it wasnt until the late 19th century that algorithm took on the meaning that it has in modern English
Another early use of the word is from 1240 in a manual titled Carmen de Algorismo composed by Alexandre de Villedieu It begins thus

Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur in qua  Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris

which translates as

Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures which number two times five

The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice or Talibus Indorum or Hindu numerals

After some days of deliberation Kumar Sangakkara the Sri Lankan captain announced on 5 April that he was resigning from the post of captain of the One Day International and Twenty20 sides in the longterm interest of the team According to him as he would be 37 by the time of the 2015 World Cup could not be sure of his place in the side then and it would be better for a new captain to be groomed now who would be at the peak of his career during that tournament He stated he was willing to captain the team for the upcoming tours of England and possibly Australia if the selectors felt this would aid the transition to a new captaincy A day after Sangakkaras announcement Mahela Jayawardene resigned from the post of vicecaptain and Aravinda de Silva from the post of Chairman of Selectors

An informal definition could be a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations which would include all computer programs including programs that do not perform numeric calculations and for example any prescribed bureaucratic procedure
Generally a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventuallyA prototypical example of an algorithm is the Euclidean algorithm to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers an example there are others is described by the flowchart above and as an example in a later section
Boolos Jeffrey  1974 1999 offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation

No human being can write fast enough or long enough or small enough†  †smaller and smaller without limit youd be trying to write on molecules on atoms on electrons to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names one after another in some notation But humans can do something equally useful in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets They can give explicit instructions for determining the nth member of the set for arbitrary finite n Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly in a form in which they could be followed by a computing machine or by a human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols
An enumerably infinite set is one whose elements can be put into onetoone correspondence with the integers Thus Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that creates output integers from an arbitrary input integer or integers that in theory can be arbitrarily large Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as y = m + n – two arbitrary input variables m and n that produce an output y But various authors attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this something on the order of for the addition example

Precise instructions in language understood by the computer for a fast efficient good process that specifies the moves of the computer machine or human equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities to find decode and then process arbitrary input integerssymbols m and n symbols + and =  and effectively produce in a reasonable time outputinteger y at a specified place and in a specified formatThe concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of decidability That notion is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules In logic the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension From such uncertainties that characterize ongoing work stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete in some sense and abstract usage of the term

Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform in a specific order to carry out a specified task such as calculating employees paychecks or printing students report cards Thus an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a Turingcomplete system Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky 1967 Savage 1987 and Gurevich 2000

 Minsky But we will also maintain with Turing  that any procedure which could naturally be called effective can in fact be realized by a simple machine Although this may seem extreme the arguments  in its favor are hard to refute
 Gurevich Turings informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine  according to Savage 1987 an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine
Turing machines can define computational processes that do not terminate The informal definitions of algorithms generally require that the algorithm always terminates This requirement renders the task of deciding whether a formal procedure is an algorithm impossible in the general case This is because of a major theorem of Computability Theory known as the Halting Problem
Typically when an algorithm is associated with processing information data can be read from an input source written to an output device and stored for further processing Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm In practice the state is stored in one or more data structures
For some such computational process the algorithm must be rigorously defined specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise That is any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with casebycase the criteria for each case must be clear and computable
Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly and are described as starting from the top and going down to the bottom an idea that is described more formally by flow of control
So far this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming This is the most common conception and it attempts to describe a task in discrete mechanical means Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation setting the value of a variable It derives from the intuition of memory as a scratchpad There is an example below of such an assignment
For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see functional programming and logic programming

Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation including natural languages pseudocode flowcharts drakoncharts programming languages or control tables processed by interpreters Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms Pseudocode flowcharts drakoncharts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms
There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables see more at finitestate machine state transition table and control table as flowcharts and drakoncharts see more at state diagram or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called sets of quadruples see more at Turing machine
Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description
1 Highlevel description
prose to describe an algorithm ignoring the implementation details At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head
2 Implementation description
prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape At this level we do not give details of states or transition function
3 Formal description
Most detailed lowest level gives the Turing machines state tableFor an example of the simple algorithm Add m+n described in all three levels see AlgorithmExamples

Algorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problemsolving and engineering algorithms The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of operation research such as dynamic programming and divideandconquer Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern
One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient runtime also known as its Big O
Typical steps in the development of algorithms

Problem definition
Development of a model
Specification of the algorithm
Designing an algorithm
Checking the correctness of the algorithm

In computer systems an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers to be effective for the intended target computers to produce output from given perhaps null input An optimal algorithm even running in old hardware would produce faster results than a nonoptimal higher time complexity algorithm for the same purpose running in more efficient hardware that is why algorithms like computer hardware are considered technology
Elegant compact programs good fast programs  The notion of simplicity and elegance appears informally in Knuth and precisely in Chaitin

Knuth   we want good algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense One criterion  is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm  Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers its simplicity and elegance etcChaitin   a program is elegant by which I mean that its the smallest possible program for producing the output that it doesChaitin prefaces his definition with Ill show you cant prove that a program is elegant—such a proof would solve the Halting problem ibid
Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm For a given function multiple algorithms may exist This is true even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer Rogers observes that It is  important to distinguish between the notion of algorithm ie procedure and the notion of function computable by algorithm ie mapping yielded by procedure The same function may have several different algorithmsUnfortunately there may be a tradeoff between goodness speed and elegance compactness—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant An example that uses Euclids algorithm appears below
Computers and computors models of computation A computer or human computor is a restricted type of machine a discrete deterministic mechanical device that blindly follows its instructions Melzaks and Lambeks primitive models reduced this notion to four elements i discrete distinguishable locations ii discrete indistinguishable counters iii an agent and iv a list of instructions that are effective relative to the capability of the agentMinsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambeks abacus model in his Very Simple Bases for Computability Minskys machine proceeds sequentially through its five or six depending on how one counts instructions unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence Besides HALT Minskys machine includes three assignment replacement substitution operations ZERO eg the contents of location replaced by 0 L ← 0 SUCCESSOR eg L ← L+1 and DECREMENT eg L ← L − 1 Rarely must a programmer write code with such a limited instruction set But Minsky shows as do Melzak and Lambek that his machine is Turing complete with only four general types of instructions conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignmentreplacementsubstitution and HALT  However a few different assignment instructions eg DECREMENT INCREMENT and ZEROCLEAREMPTY for a Minsky machine are also required for Turingcompleteness their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer The unconditional GOTO is a convenience it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero eg the instruction  Z ← 0  thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional
Simulation of an algorithm computer computor language Knuth advises the reader that the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it    immediately take pen and paper and work through an example But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulatorcomputercomputor can effectively execute Stone gives an example of this when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root If they dont then the algorithm to be effective must provide a set of rules for extracting a square rootThis means that the programmer must know a language that is effective relative to the target computing agent computercomputor
But what model should be used for the simulation Van Emde Boas observes even if we base complexity theory on abstract instead of concrete machines arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains It is at this point that the notion of simulation enters When speed is being measured the instruction set matters For example the subprogram in Euclids algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a modulus instruction available rather than just subtraction or worse just Minskys decrement
Structured programming canonical structures Per the Church–Turing thesis any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be Turing complete and per Minskys demonstrations Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment HALT Kemeny and Kurtz observe that while undisciplined use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IFTHEN GOTOs can result in spaghetti code a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions on the other hand it is also possible and not too hard to write badly structured programs in a structured language Tausworthe augments the three BöhmJacopini canonical structures SEQUENCE IFTHENELSE and WHILEDO with two more DOWHILE and CASE An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical inductionCanonical flowchart symbols The graphical aide called a flowchart offers a way to describe and document an algorithm and a computer program of one Like the program flow of a Minsky machine a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down Its primary symbols are only four the directed arrow showing program flow the rectangle SEQUENCE GOTO the diamond IFTHENELSE and the dot ORtie The Böhm–Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes Substructures can nest in rectangles but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure The symbols and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list From this follows a simple algorithm which can be stated in a highlevel description in English prose as
Highlevel description

If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number
Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set
For each remaining number in the set if this number is larger than the current largest number consider this number to be the largest number in the set
When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the setQuasiformal description
Written in prose but much closer to the highlevel language of a computer program the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode or pidgin code

Euclids algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor GCD to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII Elementary Number Theory of his Elements Euclid poses the problem thus Given two numbers not prime to one another to find their greatest common measure He defines A number to be a multitude composed of units a counting number a positive integer not including zero To measure is to place a shorter measuring length s successively q times along longer length l until the remaining portion r is less than the shorter length s In modern words remainder r = l − q×s q being the quotient or remainder r is the modulus the integerfractional part left over after the divisionFor Euclids method to succeed the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements i the lengths must not be zero AND ii the subtraction must be “proper” ie a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger alternately the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero
Euclids original proof adds a third requirement the two lengths must not be prime to one another Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a reductio ad absurdum proof that the two numbers common measure is in fact the greatest While Nicomachus algorithm is the same as Euclids when the numbers are prime to one another it yields the number 1 for their common measure So to be precise the following is really Nicomachus algorithm

The following algorithm is framed as Knuths fourstep version of Euclids and Nicomachus but rather than using division to find the remainder it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length s from the remaining length r until r is less than s The highlevel description shown in boldface is adapted from Knuth 19732–4
INPUT

1 Into two locations L and S put the numbers l and s that represent the two lengths
  INPUT L S
2 Initialize R make the remaining length r equal to the startinginitialinput length l
  R ← L

E0 Ensure r ≥ s

3 Ensure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R
  IF R  S THEN
    the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchangesteps 4 5 and 6
    GOTO step 6
  ELSE
    swap the contents of R and S
4   L ← R this first step is redundant but is useful for later discussion
5   R ← S
6   S ← L

E1 Find remainder Until the remaining length r in R is less than the shorter length s in S repeatedly subtract the measuring number s in S from the remaining length r in R

7 IF S  R THEN
    done measuring so
    GOTO 10
  ELSE
    measure again
8   R ← R − S
9   Remainderloop
    GOTO 7

E2 Is the remainder zero EITHER i the last measure was exact the remainder in R is zero and the program can halt OR ii the algorithm must continue the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S

10 IF R = 0 THEN
     done so
     GOTO step 15
   ELSE
     CONTINUE TO step 11

E3 Interchange s and r The nut of Euclids algorithm Use remainder r to measure what was previously smaller number s L serves as a temporary location

11  L ← R
12  R ← S
13  S ← L
14  Repeat the measuring process
    GOTO 7

The following version of Euclids algorithm requires only six core instructions to do what thirteen are required to do by Inelegant worse Inelegant requires more types of instructions The flowchart of Elegant can be found at the top of this article In the unstructured Basic language the steps are numbered and the instruction LET  =  is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←

How Elegant works In place of an outer Euclid loop Elegant shifts back and forth between two coloops an A  B loop that computes A ← A − B and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A This works because when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S  Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend the minuend can become s the new measuring length and the subtrahend can become the new r the length to be measured in other words the sense of the subtraction reverses
The following version can be used with Object Oriented languages

Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do A few test cases usually give some confidence in the core functionality But tests are not enough For test cases one source uses 3009 and 884 Knuth suggested 40902 24140 Another interesting case is the two relatively prime numbers 14157 and 5950
But exceptional cases must be identified and tested Will Inelegant perform properly when R  S S  R R = S Ditto for Elegant B  A A  B A = B Yes to all What happens when one number is zero both numbers are zero Inelegant computes forever in all cases Elegant computes forever when A = 0 What happens if negative numbers are entered Fractional numbers If the input numbers ie the domain of the function computed by the algorithmprogram is to include only positive integers including zero then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm and the program that instantiates it is a partial function rather than a total function A notable failure due to exceptions is the Ariane 5 Flight 501 rocket failure June 4 1996
Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction Knuth demonstrates the application of mathematical induction to an extended version of Euclids algorithm and he proposes a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof

Elegance compactness versus goodness speed With only six core instructions Elegant is the clear winner compared to Inelegant at thirteen instructions However Inelegant is faster it arrives at HALT in fewer steps Algorithm analysis indicates why this is the case Elegant does two conditional tests in every subtraction loop whereas Inelegant only does one As the algorithm usually requires many loopthroughs on average much time is wasted doing a B = 0 test that is needed only after the remainder is computed
Can the algorithms be improved Once the programmer judges a program fit and effective—that is it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes can it be improved
The compactness of Inelegant can be improved by the elimination of five steps But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm rather it can only be done heuristically ie by exhaustive search examples to be found at Busy beaver trial and error cleverness insight application of inductive reasoning etc Observe that steps 4 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11 12 and 13 Comparison with Elegant provides a hint that these steps together with steps 2 and 3 can be eliminated This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight which makes it more elegant than Elegant at nine steps
The speed of Elegant can be improved by moving the B=0 test outside of the two subtraction loops This change calls for the addition of three instructions B = 0 A = 0 GOTO Now Elegant computes the examplenumbers faster whether this is always the case for any given A B and R S would require a detailed analysis

It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource such as time or storage is theoretically required for a given algorithm Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers estimates for example the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of On using the big O notation with n as the length of the list At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values the largest number found so far and its current position in the input list Therefore it is said to have a space requirement of O1 if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted or On if it is counted
Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time space or effort than others For example a binary search algorithm with cost Olog n  outperforms a sequential search cost On  when used for table lookups on sorted lists or arrays

The analysis and study of algorithms is a discipline of computer science and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or implementation In this sense algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation Usually pseudocode is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation However ultimately most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardwaresoftware platforms and their algorithmic efficiency is eventually put to the test using real code For the solution of a one off problem the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences unless n is extremely large but for algorithms designed for fast interactive commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign
Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance Benchmarks may be used to compare beforeafter potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization
Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis though and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner

There are various ways to classify algorithms each with its own merits



==========
==
Most clean sheets 18Chelsea
Fewest clean sheets 5Fulham



==========

One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means

Recursion
A recursive algorithm is one that invokes makes reference to itself repeatedly until a certain condition also known as termination condition matches which is a method common to functional programming Iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops and sometimes additional data structures like stacks to solve the given problems Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other For example towers of Hanoi is well understood using recursive implementation Every recursive version has an equivalent but possibly more or less complex iterative version and vice versa
Logical
An algorithm may be viewed as controlled logical deduction This notion may be expressed as Algorithm = logic + control The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms This is the basis for the logic programming paradigm In pure logic programming languages the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component The appeal of this approach is the elegant semantics a change in the axioms produces a welldefined change in the algorithm
Serial parallel or distributed
Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time Those computers are sometimes called serial computers An algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm as opposed to parallel algorithms or distributed algorithms Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a computer network Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently but their communication overhead is expensive Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable Some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems
Deterministic or nondeterministic
Deterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas nondeterministic algorithms solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of heuristics
Exact or approximate
While many algorithms reach an exact solution approximation algorithms seek an approximation that is closer to the true solution The approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the Knapsack problem where there is a set of given items Its goal is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value Each item has some weight and some value Total weight that can be carried is no more than some fixed number X So the solution must consider weights of items as well as their value
Quantum algorithm
They run on a realistic model of quantum computation The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum or use some essential feature of Quantum computing such as quantum superposition or quantum entanglement



==========

Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm There is a certain number of paradigms each different from the other Furthermore each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms Some common paradigms are

Bruteforce or exhaustive search
This is the naive method of trying every possible solution to see which is best
Divide and conquer
A divide and conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem usually recursively until the instances are small enough to solve easily One such example of divide and conquer is merge sorting Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a decrease and conquer algorithm that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms An example of a decrease and conquer algorithm is the binary search algorithm
Search and enumeration
Many problems such as playing chess can be modeled as problems on graphs A graph exploration algorithm specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems This category also includes search algorithms branch and bound enumeration and backtracking
Randomized algorithm
Such algorithms make some choices randomly or pseudorandomly They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical see heuristic method below For some of these problems it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some randomness Whether randomized algorithms with polynomial time complexity can be the fastest algorithms for some problems is an open question known as the P versus NP problem There are two large classes of such algorithmsMonte Carlo algorithms return a correct answer with highprobability Eg RP is the subclass of these that run in polynomial time
Las Vegas algorithms always return the correct answer but their running time is only probabilistically bound eg ZPPReduction of complexity
This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a betterknown problem for which we have hopefully asymptotically optimal algorithms The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithms For example one selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list the expensive portion and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list the cheap portion This technique is also known as transform and conquer
Back tracking
In this approach multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution

For optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following

Linear programming
When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category such as the popular simplex algorithm Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the maximum flow problem for directed graphs If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an integer then it is classified in integer programming A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial ie the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway In the general case a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used depending on the difficulty of the problem
Dynamic programming
When a problem shows optimal substructures—meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems—and overlapping subproblems meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances a quicker approach called dynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed For example Floyd–Warshall algorithm the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices Dynamic programming and memoization go together The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition memoization does not help hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems By using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity
The greedy method
A greedy algorithm is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures in this case not of the problem but of a given solution Such algorithms start with some solution which may be given or have been constructed in some way and improve it by making small modifications For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at local optima that is at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method Huffman Tree Kruskal Prim Sollin are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem
The heuristic method
In optimization problems heuristic algorithms can be used to find a solution close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress In principle if run for an infinite amount of time they will find the optimal solution Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time Such algorithms include local search tabu search simulated annealing and genetic algorithms Some of them like simulated annealing are nondeterministic algorithms while others like tabu search are deterministic When a bound on the error of the nonoptimal solution is known the algorithm is further categorized as an approximation algorithm

Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms Related problems in one field are often studied together Some example classes are search algorithms sorting algorithms merge algorithms numerical algorithms graph algorithms string algorithms computational geometric algorithms combinatorial algorithms medical algorithms machine learning cryptography data compression algorithms and parsing techniques
Fields tend to overlap with each other and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other sometimes completely unrelated fields For example dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields



==========


Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size

Constant time if the time needed by the algorithm is the same regardless of the input size Eg an access to an array element
Linear time if the time is proportional to the input size Eg the traverse of a list
Logarithmic time if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size Eg binary search algorithm
Polynomial time if the time is a power of the input size Eg the bubble sort algorithm has quadratic time complexity
Exponential time if the time is an exponential function of the input size Eg Bruteforce searchSome problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms There are also mappings from some problems to other problems Owing to this it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them

Algorithms by themselves are not usually patentable In the United States a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts numbers or signals does not constitute processes USPTO 2006 and hence algorithms are not patentable as in Gottschalk v Benson However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable For example in Diamond v Diehr the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed patentable The patenting of software is highly controversial and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms especially data compression algorithms such as Unisys LZW patent

Muhammad ibn Mūsā alKhwārizmī a Persian mathematician wrote the Aljabr in the 9th century The terms algorism and algorithm are derived from the name alKhwārizmī while the term algebra is derived from the book Aljabr In Europe the word algorithm was originally used to refer to the sets of rules and techniques used by AlKhwarizmi to solve algebraic equations before later being generalized to refer to any set of rules or techniques This eventually culminated in Leibnizs notion of the calculus ratiocinator ca 1680

Logical machines 1870 – Stanley Jevons logical abacus and logical machine The technical problem was to reduce Boolean equations when presented in a form similar to what is now known as Karnaugh maps Jevons 1880 describes first a simple abacus of slips of wood furnished with pins contrived so that any part or class of the logical combinations can be picked out mechanically  More recently however I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a Logical Machine His machine came equipped with certain moveable wooden rods and at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano etc  With this machine he could analyze a syllogism or any other simple logical argumentThis machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society Another logician John Venn however in his 1881 Symbolic Logic turned a jaundiced eye to this effort I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines  it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines see more at Algorithm characterizations But not to be outdone he too presented a plan somewhat analogous I apprehend to Prof Jevons abacus  And again corresponding to Prof Jevonss logical machine the following contrivance may be described I prefer to call it merely a logicaldiagram machine  but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machineJacquard loom Hollerith punch cards telegraphy and telephony – the electromechanical relay Bell and Newell 1971 indicate that the Jacquard loom 1801 precursor to Hollerith cards punch cards 1887 and telephone switching technologies were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers By the mid19th century the telegraph the precursor of the telephone was in use throughout the world its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as dots and dashes a common sound By the late 19th century the ticker tape ca 1870s was in use as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 US census Then came the teleprinter ca 1910 with its punchedpaper use of Baudot code on tape
Telephoneswitching networks of electromechanical relays invented 1835 was behind the work of George Stibitz 1937 the inventor of the digital adding device As he worked in Bell Laboratories he observed the burdensome use of mechanical calculators with gears He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea When the tinkering was over Stibitz had constructed a binary adding deviceDavis 2000 observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay with its two binary states open and closed

It was only with the development beginning in the 1930s of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned

Symbols and rules In rapid succession the mathematics of George Boole 1847 1854 Gottlob Frege 1879 and Giuseppe Peano 1888–1889 reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules Peanos The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method 1888 was the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic languageBut Heijenoort gives Frege 1879 this kudos Freges is perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic  in which we see a  formula language that is a lingua characterica a language written with special symbols for pure thought that is free from rhetorical embellishments  constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell in their Principia Mathematica 1910–1913
The paradoxes At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature in particular the BuraliForti paradox 1897 the Russell paradox 1902–03 and the Richard Paradox The resultant considerations led to Kurt Gödels paper 1931—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of recursion to numbers
Effective calculability In an effort to solve the Entscheidungsproblem defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928 mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an effective method or effective calculation or effective calculability ie a calculation that would succeed In rapid succession the following appeared Alonzo Church Stephen Kleene and JB Rossers λcalculus a finely honed definition of general recursion from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of Jacques Herbrand cf Gödels Princeton lectures of 1934 and subsequent simplifications by Kleene Churchs proof that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable Emil Posts definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yesno decision about the next instruction Alan Turings proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his a automatic machine—in effect almost identical to Posts formulation J Barkley Rossers definition of effective method in terms of a machine SC Kleenes proposal of a precursor to Church thesis that he called Thesis I and a few years later Kleenes renaming his Thesis Churchs Thesis and proposing Turings Thesis

Emil Post 1936 described the actions of a computer human being as follows

two concepts are involved that of a symbol space in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out and a fixed unalterable set of directionsHis symbol space would be

a twoway infinite sequence of spaces or boxes The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space being capable of being in and operating in but one box at a time a box is to admit of but two possible conditions ie being empty or unmarked and having a single mark in it say a vertical strokeOne box is to be singled out and called the starting point a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes ie INPUT being marked with a stroke Likewise the answer ie OUTPUT is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxesA set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem This process terminates only when it comes to the direction of type C  ie STOP See more at Post–Turing machine
Alan Turings work preceded that of Stibitz 1937 it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing Turings biographer believed that Turings use of a typewriterlike model derived from a youthful interest Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy Mrs Turing had a typewriter and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter mechanical Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy ticker tape machines and teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences
Turing—his model of computation is now called a Turing machine—begins as did Post with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and states of mind But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers
Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a childs arithmetic bookI assume then that the computation is carried out on onedimensional paper ie on a tape divided into squares I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finiteThe behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing and his state of mind at that moment We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment If he wishes to observe more he must use successive observations We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finiteLet us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into simple operations which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further dividedTurings reduction yields the following

The simple operations must therefore include
a Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares
b Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squaresIt may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind The most general single operation must therefore be taken to be one of the following

A A possible change a of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind
B A possible change b of observed squares together with a possible change of state of mindWe may now construct a machine to do the work of this computerA few years later Turing expanded his analysis thesis definition with this forceful expression of it

A function is said to be effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite mathematical expressible definition  he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to Gödel Herbrand Kleene Church Turing and Post  We may take this statement literally understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine It is possible to give a mathematical description in a certain normal form of the structures of these machines The development of these ideas leads to the authors definition of a computable function and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability  
† We shall use the expression computable function to mean a function calculable by a machine and we let effectively calculable refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions

J Barkley Rosser defined an effective mathematical method in the following manner italicization added

Effective method is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps With this special meaning three different precise definitions have been given to date his footnote 5 see discussion immediately below The simplest of these to state due to Post and Turing says essentially that an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and later reading the answer All three definitions are equivalent so it doesnt matter which one is used Moreover the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one Rosser 1939225–226Rossers footnote No 5 references the work of 1 Church and Kleene and their definition of λdefinability in particular Churchs use of it in his An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory 1936 2 Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödels use in his famous paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I 1931 and 3 Post 1936 and Turing 1936–37 in their mechanismmodels of computation
Stephen C Kleene defined as his nowfamous Thesis I known as the Church–Turing thesis But he did this in the following context boldface in original

12 Algorithmic theories In setting up a complete algorithmic theory what we do is to describe a procedure performable for each set of values of the independent variables which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer yes or no to the question is the predicate value true Kleene 1943273

The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th FIFA World Cup the quadrennial world championship for mens national football teams organised by FIFA It took place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014 after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2007 It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition the first being in 1950 and the fifth time that it was held in South America Many fans and pundits alike also consider this edition of the World Cup to be one of the greatest ever held31 national teams advanced through qualification competitions to join the host nation in the final tournament with Bosnia and Herzegovina as only debutant A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues located in as many host cities across Brazil For the first time at a World Cup finals match officials used goalline technology as well as vanishing spray for free kicks FIFA Fan Fests in each host city gathered a total of 5 million people and the country received 1 million visitors from 202 countries Every World Cupwinning team since the first tournament in 1930 – Argentina Brazil England France Germany Italy Spain and Uruguay – qualified for this tournament Spain the title holders were eliminated at the group stage along with England and Italy Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16 and France exited in the quarterfinals Host nation Brazil who had won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup lost to Germany 7–1 in the semifinals and eventually finished in fourth place
In the final Germany defeated Argentina 1–0 to win the tournament and secure the countrys fourth world title the first after the German reunification in 1990 when as West Germany they also beat Argentina in the World Cup final Germany became the first European team to win a World Cup staged in the Americas and this result marked the third consecutive title won by a European team after Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010

In March 2003 FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since 1978 in line with its thenactive policy of rotating the right to host the World Cup among different confederations With the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted in South Africa it would be the second consecutive World Cup outside Europe which was a first for the tournament It was also second in the Southern Hemisphere Only Brazil and Colombia formally declared their candidacy but after the withdrawal of the latter from the process Brazil was officially elected as host nation unopposed on 30 October 2007

Following qualification matches played between June 2011 and November 2013 the following 32 teams – shown with their last pretournament FIFA world ranking – qualified for the final tournament Twentyfour of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals Colombia qualified for the World Cup after 16 years of absence while the 2018 World Cup hosts Russia and Belgium returned after 12 years Paraguay failed to qualify for the first time since 1994 This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine ranked 16th while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia ranked 62nd



==========


The 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups In preparation for this the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highestranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot As with the previous tournaments FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cupwinning players Under the draw procedure one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams
