      "Humanistic therapy RogersHumanistic therapy aims to achieve selfactualization Carl Rogers 1961  In this style of therapy the therapist will focus on the patient themselves as opposed to the problem which the patient is afflicted with  The overall goal of this therapy is that by treating the patient as human instead of client will help get to the source of the problem and hopefully resolve the problem in an effective manner Humanistic therapy has been on the rise in recent years and has been associated with numerous positive benefits It is considered to be one of the core elements needed therapeutic effectiveness and a significant contributor to not only the well being of the patient but society as a whole Some say that all of the therapeutic approaches today draw from the humanistic approach in some regard and that humanistic therapy is the best way for treat a patient  Humanistic therapy can be used on people of all ages however it is very popular among children in its variant known as play therapy  Children are often sent to therapy due to outburst that they have in a school or home setting the theory is that by treating the child in a setting that is similar to the area that they are having their disruptive behavior the child will be more likely to learn from the therapy and have an effective outcome In play therapy the clinicians will play with their client usually with toys or a tea party  Playing is the typical behavior of a child and therefore playing with the therapist will come as a natural response to the child  In playing together the clinician will ask the patient questions but due to the setting the questions no longer seem intrusive and therapeutic more like a normal conversation  This should help the patient realizes issues they have and confess them to the therapist with less difficulty than they may experience in a traditional counselling setting\n",
      "Cognitive behavioural therapy Ellis and BeckCognitive behavioural therapy aims to influence thought and cognition Beck 1977 This form of therapy relies on not only the components of behavioral therapy as mentioned before but also the elements of cognitive psychology  This relies on not only the clients behavioral problems that could have arisen from conditioning but also there negative schemas and distorted perceptions of the world around them  These negative schemas may be causing distress in the life of the patient for example the schemas may be giving them unrealistic expectations for how well they should perform at their job or how they should look physically  When these expectations are not met it will often result in maladaptive behaviors such as depression obsessive compulsions and anxiety  With cognitive behavior therapy the goal is to change the schemas that are causing the stress in a persons life and hopefully replace them with more realistic ones  Once the negative schemas have been replaced it will hopefully cause a remission of the patients symptoms  CBT is considered particularly effective in the treatment of depression and has even been used lately in group settings  It is felt that using CBT in a group setting aids in giving its members a sense of support and decreasing the likelihood of them dropping out of therapy before the treatment has had time to work properly CBT has been found to be an effective treatments for many patients even those who do not have diseases and disorders typically thought of as psychiatric ones For example patients with the disease multiple sclerosis have found a lot of help using CBT  The treatment often helps the patients cope with the disorder they have and how they can adapt to their new lives without developing new problems such as depression or negative schemas about themselvesAccording to RAND therapies are difficult to provide to all patients in need A lack of funding and understanding of symptoms provides a major roadblock that is not easily avoided Individual symptoms and responses to treatments vary creating a disconnect between patient society and care giversprofessionals\n",

      "Agile software development fixes time iteration duration quality and ideally resources in advance though maintaining fixed resources may be difficult if developers are often pulled away from tasks to handle production incidents while the scope remains variable The customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration However teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time resources and scope commonly known as the project management triangle Efforts to add scope to the fixed time and resources of agile software development may result in decreased quality\n",
